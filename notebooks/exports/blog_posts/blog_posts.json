One of the things that really gets my goat is when companies build employer brand by over-indexing on banalities (\u201clook we have a ping pong table!\u201d, \u201clook we\u2019re a startup so you\u2019ll have a huge impact\u201d, etc.) instead of focusing on the narratives that make them special.\n\nHiring engineers is really hard. It\u2019s hard for tech giants, and it\u2019s hard for small companies\u2026 but it\u2019s especially hard for small companies people haven\u2019t quite heard of, and they can use all the help they can get because talking about impact and ping pong tables just doesn\u2019t cut it anymore.\n\nAt interviewing.io, making small companies shine is core to our business, and I\u2019ll share some of what we\u2019ve learned about branding as a result. I\u2019ll also walk you through 3 simple exercises you can do to help you craft and distill your employer brand\u2026 in a way that highlights what\u2019s actually special about you and will make great engineers excited to learn more.\n\nIf I have my druthers, this will be one of three posts on brand. This first one will focus on how to craft your story, the second will show you how to use that story to write great job descriptions, and the final one will focus on how to take the story you\u2019ve created and get it out into the world in front of the kinds of people you\u2019d want to hire.\n\nSo, onto the first post!\n\n## What is employer brand, and why does it matter?\n\nCompanies like Google have built a great brand, and this brand is largely what makes it possible for them to hire thousands of good engineers every year \u2014 when you think of Google (or, more recently, Microsoft!), you might think of an army of competent, first-principles thinkers competently building products people love\u2026 or maybe a niche group of engineers working on moonshots that will change the world.\n\nThis is employer brand. Put simply, it\u2019s what comes to mind when prospective candidates think about your company. Employer brand encompasses every aspect of your narrative: whether people use/like your product, the problem you\u2019re trying to solve, your founding story, your mission, your culture, and what generally what it\u2019s like to work for you. Put another way, all of these attributes (and others besides!) coalesce into the visceral feeling people get when they imagine working for you.\n\nBrand is the single most important thing for getting candidates in the door \u2014 even if you have a stellar personal network, in most cases, that\u2019ll usually only last you until your first 30 hires or so \u2014 after that, your networks begin to sort of converge on one another. Even so, despite how important brand is for hiring, building it is one of the psychologically hardest things to do at the beginning of your journey because the opportunity cost of spending your time on ANYTHING is staggering, and it\u2019s really hard to justify writing blog posts and hosting events and speaking at conferences when you have to build product and make individual hires and do 50 kabillion other things.\n\n**But, until you build a brand and get it out in the world, you\u2019re going to be hacking through the jungle with a proverbial machete, making hires one by one, trying to charm each one by telling them your story. And once you have a brand, all of a sudden, sourcing is going to feel really, really different (just like it feels when you\u2019ve found product market fit!).**\n\nOver time, if you continue to tell your own story, you, too, will see how much easier sourcing and hiring can be. So, let\u2019s talk about how to craft the right narrative and then proudly shout it from the rooftops.\n\n## Why interviewing.io knows about branding\n\nI mentioned earlier that a lot of what we do at interviewing.io is help our customers put their best foot forward and present themselves to engineers in a way that\u2019s authentic and compelling. I\u2019ll show you some examples of good copy in a moment, but here\u2019s a bit of our flow to put it in context.  \nWhen engineers do really well in practice, they unlock our jobs portal, where they can see a list of companies and roles, like so:\n\n![d988c-ff3-compressed.webp](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d988c_ff3_compressed_38c9b5f5ba.webp)\n\nAs you can see, companies simply describe who they are and what they do, and top-performing engineers just book real interviews with one click. Because our goal is to remove obstacles from engineers talking to other engineers, we don\u2019t have talent managers or talent advocates or, as they\u2019re often called, recruiters, on staff to talk to our candidates and try to convince them to interview at a certain company. As a result, we often find ourselves coaching companies on how to present themselves, given limited time and space. We do work with quite a few companies whose brands are household names, but a good chunk of our customers are smaller, fast-growing companies. **What\u2019s interesting is that while, on our platform, a household name can have 7X the engagement of a company no one\u2019s heard of, companies no one\u2019s heard of that have exceptional brand narratives aren\u2019t far behind burgeoning unicorns!** (We define engagement as the frequency with which candidates who look at our jobs portal then choose to visit that employer\u2019s page.)\n\nAnd that\u2019s why having a brand story matters\u2026 and why we\u2019re equipped to talk about it at some depth.\n\n## What constitutes brand\n\nBelow are some attributes that can make up a brand story. As you look at the list, think about what each of these corresponds to in your company, and then, think about which of these are the most unique to you. For instance, every early-stage startup can say they have a culture characterized by autonomy and the potential for huge impact. It\u2019s become a trope that doesn\u2019t differentiate anyone in any way anymore and is therefore probably not worth emphasizing. On the other hand, if you are solving a problem that a lot of your candidates happen to have or if you use a really cool tech stack that attracts some niche community, that\u2019s really special and worth emphasizing.\n\n- Your product and whether people have heard of it/like it\n- Your growth numbers if they\u2019re impressive\n- Your tech stack and how flashy and cool it is\n- Your founding story and mission\u2026 are you working on a problem that people care about personally? If not, are you disrupting some outdated, inefficient way to do things?\n- How hard are the problems you\u2019re solving? Both technically and otherwise?\n- How elite is your team?\n- What is it like to work for you, both with regard to overall culture and then eng culture specifically?[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n  - Overall culture:\n    - Are you known for kindness/work-life balance? Or grueling hours? (Either can be good depending on whom you want to attract.)\n    - What portion of your employees have gone on to found startups?\n    - Do you have a lot of organization/structure or are you chaos pirates?\n  - Eng culture:\n    - Are you more pragmatic/hacker-y vs. academic?\n    - Do you subscribe to or actively reject any particular development methodologies (e.g. agile)?\n    - Do you tend to roll your own solutions in house or do you try to use 3rd party tools wherever possible?\n    - Do you open source parts of your code? Or regularly contribute to open source?\n\n## How to craft your story in 3 easy exercises!\n\nThere isn\u2019t a single good formula for what to focus on or highlight when crafting this story, but there are a few exercises that we\u2019ve seen be effective. You can do them in the order below, and by the end, you should have a concise, authentic, pithy narrative that you can shout proudly to the world.\n\nWe\u2019ve found that it makes sense to do these exercises in the order below. **First, you\u2019re going to go with your gut and craft a high-level story. Then you\u2019ll embellish it with details that make you unique and with anecdotes from your employees. And finally, you\u2019ll edit it down into something crisp.** As you work, you can use the list from the \u201cWhat constitutes brand\u201d section above as a reference. Note that, in general, your story plus details shouldn\u2019t have more than 3 distinct ideas total or it\u2019ll start to feel a bit all over the place.\n\n### Exercise 1 \u2013 The story itself\n\nImagine you have a smart, technical friend you respect but who doesn\u2019t know anything about your company\u2019s space. Quick, how would you describe what your company does and why it matters to them? Write it down (and target 5-6 sentences\u2026 but don\u2019t worry too much about editing it yet\u2026 we\u2019ll do that later).\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling a bit stuck, here are some questions to get you started \u2014 think about how you might answer if your friend were asking each of these:\n\n- Why does the company exist/what does your product do, and why does that matter?\n- Why are you going to succeed where others have failed?\n- Why does the company matter to you personally?\n- What do you know that no one else does about your space?\n- What is your company doing that no one else is doing, and why does that matter?\n\nAs you do this exercise, note that when talking to your friend, you dispense with flowery language and explain things succinctly and clearly in simple terms! And that\u2019s the point \u2014 the audience you\u2019re selling to is not different than your friend, and your friend probably shares the same cynicism about disingenuous branding that they do!\n\n### Exercise 2 \u2013 The unique embellishments\n\nOnce you have the story you came up with above, which will likely be at a pretty high level, it\u2019s time to drill down into the details that make you special. These details will likely be 2nd order, in the sense that they won\u2019t be as broad or all-encompassing as the attributes that came to mind in the first exercise, but they might still be special and unique and worth noting.\n\nSome examples of unique embellishments can be:\n\n- Your tech stack\n  - Do you use any cutting-edge programming languages that one might not often see being used in production? If so, it might be a bit polarizing but attract the community around that language. More on the value of polarization when it comes to unique embellishments below.\n- Unfettered access to some type of user/a specific group you care about that your product impacts\n  - Do you build products for Hollywood? Or for VCs? Or for schools? Some portion of your candidates, depending on their interests outside of work or their future career ambitions, are going to be really excited that they\u2019ll get more direct access to users who operate in these worlds.\n- Unique lifestyle/work culture stuff like working remotely or pair programming\n  - E.g. 37Signals and Pivotal respectively\n- Access to a ton of data/ability to work on massively distributed systems\n  - E.g. even in its early days, Twitch had almost as much ingest as YouTube, and this was a meaningful selling point to candidates who wanted to work at scale but didn\u2019t necessarily want to work at FAANG\n\n#### The surprising value of polarization\n\nToday\u2019s job seeker is in equal parts jaded and savvy, and we\u2019re currently in a labor market climate where talent has the power. The latter makes branding especially important, and by now, engineers have been told all manners of generalities about how much impact they\u2019re going to have if they join a small startup and how whatever you\u2019re working on is going to change the world\u2026 to the point where these things have become cliches that shows like Silicon Valley deride with impunity. To avoid cliches like this, think about what TRULY makes you special, and even if it\u2019s a bit polarizing, own it. It\u2019s your story, and the more honest you are about who you are and what you do, the more trust you\u2019ll build with your audience and the more they\u2019ll want to engage.\n\nAnother way to say this is that the most memorable stories might be shrouded in a bit of controversy. That\u2019s not to say that you have to be controversial or contrive it when it isn\u2019t there, but if you do operate in a space or have some aspect to your culture or tech stack that not everyone agrees with, you might find that the resulting self-selection among candidates can work to your advantage. Below are some examples of polarizing narratives.\n\n- **Your work style.** Some companies really value work-life balance, whereas others exalt burning the midnight oil. Some run on chaos and some take a more orderly approach. Some work by the book, and some choose more of a bulldoze your way to success and ask forgiveness rather than permission approach. An example of the latter is Uber \u2014 for a long time, their culture was known for a take-no-prisoners approach to getting things done, and this approach has a certain type of appeal for the right people.\n- **Your tech stack.** Certainly choosing your tech stack is, first and foremost, and engineering decision, but this decision has some implications for hiring, and choosing a fringe or niche stack or language can be a great way to attract the entire community around it. The more culty a language, the more fiercely passionate its acolytes will be about working for you (e.g. Rust\u2026 though by the time this guide comes out it might be something else!). Note that it doesn\u2019t have to be thaaaat fringe of a language choice as long as there\u2019s a tight-knit community around it, e.g. C#.\n- **Your engineering culture.** Do you subscribe to any particular type of methodology that might be controversial, e.g. are you super into TDD? Are you adamant about rolling all your own everything?\n\nNote that there is no right or wrong here \u2014 to loosely paraphase Tolstoy, every startup is broken in its own way, and one saying we\u2019ve heard is that, especially during the early days, The only thing you can do wrong is not own who you are \u2014 if you misrepresent how you work or make decisions, you\u2019ll find yourself in one of two regrettable positions: either your hires will leave well before their time or you\u2019ll have a bunch of people marching in different directions or completely paralyzed and unable to choose the right course of action on their own.\n\n### Exercise 3 \u2013 Your employees\u2019 unique perspective\n\nAs your team grows beyond you, you will find that your employees\u2019 reasons for working for you are likely different than the answers to the questions above. Talking to them (or, if you don\u2019t want to put them on the spot, having another team member do so) can surface gold for your narrative. In particular, when I was a recruiter, one of the most useful exercises I did was asking my client to introduce me to a very specific handful of engineers. **In particular, I was looking for people who 1) didn\u2019t come to the company through personal referrals and 2) had a lot of good offers during their last job search. Why this mix of people? Because they\u2019re the ones who, despite no personal connection to the company and despite other having other options, actively chose to work for you!** You\u2019d be surprised what stories I heard, and they\u2019re rarely just about the company mission. For instance, one candidate I spoke to was really excited about the chance to closely interact with investors because he wanted to start his own company one day. Another was stoked at the chance to use Go in production.\n\nSometimes you\u2019ll be surprised by what you\u2019ll hear because the people working at your company might be there for very different reasons than you, but these anecdotes help flesh out your narrative and make it feel a bit more personal and real.\n\nOnce you have a few choice tidbits from employees, ask yourself whether each one is somehow charming or unusual and whether it\u2019s a reason that a lot of people would find compelling about your company. If it\u2019s all of these things, it should likely make it in your narrative. If it\u2019s not particularly original (e.g. short commute) it may not be worth calling out in your primary narrative, but it\u2019s well worth repeating and telling once you actually interact with candidates.\n\n## The finished product\n\nSo, what should the finished product look like? At a minimum, it\u2019ll be some concise, compelling copy that you can use in your job descriptions. Hopefully, though, it\u2019s more than that. Hopefully it becomes a consistent refrain you and your team use during calls, interviews, maybe investor pitches\u2026 a way to highlight all the things you\u2019re most proud of about your company and the things that make you special\u2026 without having to reinvent the wheel every time.\n\n## Is brand the be-all and end-all of hiring? Not quite.\n\nIn closing, I\u2019d like to leave you with a word or two of encouragement. Sure, as you saw in this post, brand matters. Having a great story will you get somewhere, but it won\u2019t get you everywhere with candidates, and the truth is that the more established you are, the more candidates will come to you. But\u2026 there\u2019s one piece of data we found in our interviewing and hiring adventures that flies in the face of brand completely proscribing your hiring destiny.\n\nWhen we looked at how often candidates wanted to work at companies after interviewing there as a function of brand strength, its impact was not statistically significant. In other words, we found that brand strength didn\u2019t matter at all when it came to either whether the candidate wanted to move forward or how excited the candidate was to work at the company. This was a bit surprising, so I decided to dig deeper. Maybe brand strength doesn\u2019t matter overall but matters when the interviewer or the questions they asked aren\u2019t highly rated? In other words, can brand buttress less-than-stellar interviewers? Not so, according to our data. Brand didn\u2019t matter even when you corrected for interviewer quality. In fact, of the top 10 best-rated companies on our platform, half have no brand to speak of, 3 are mid-sized YC companies that command respect in Bay Area circles but are definitely not universally recognizable, and only 2 have anything approaching household name status.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the takeaway here? **Maybe the most realistic thing we can say is that while brand likely matters a lot for getting candidates in the door, once they\u2019re in, no matter how well-branded you are, they\u2019re yours to lose.**\n\nSo, take heart.\n\n*Portions of this post will also appear in part in an upcoming, comprehensive [Guide to Technical Recruiting and Hiring](https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/about) published by Holloway (where you can sign up if you\u2019d like to read, review, or contribute to it).*\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. The [2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#work) recently came out, and it turns out that in the US the most important thing for engineers is office/company culture\u2026 which realistically refers to the eng team culture because that\u2019s engineers will spend most of their time.

We surveyed 1000 engineers to find out.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: July 31, 2022; Last updated: May 6, 2024\n\nIt looks like we\u2019re entering a recession. One of the hardest things about it is the lack of reliable information about whether companies are still hiring and what hiring freezes even mean. Arguably the two most impactful eng hiring freezes were announced by [Facebook (May 4, 2022)](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-is-freezing-hiring-heres-why-and-who-it-impacts-2022-5) and then [Google (July 20, 2022)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/20/23271634/google-hiring-pause-two-weeks-review-headcount-needs). Facebook\u2019s freeze is allegedly partial, targeting roles below L7 and excluding machine learning engineers. Google\u2019s freeze is allegedly all-encompassing but may only last 2 weeks. But what\u2019s actually going on? To make some sense of a bunch of contradictory information about Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s hiring freezes in the press and on Blind, we decided to ask the people who, outside of Google leadership, will probably know best what\u2019s going on \u2013 engineers who are *interviewing at these companies right now.* In this post, we\u2019ll share what we learned from surveying 1003 of our users.\n\nWhy do we care about these freezes at interviewing.io? First off, they affect our users \u2013 a good chunk of our users are practicing for upcoming [Google](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google) and [Facebook](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/meta-facebook) interviews. Moreover, these freezes materially affect our business. On our platform, you can practice with engineers from a specific company, and many of our users opt to practice with Google engineers before their Google interview and Facebook engineers before they begin the [Facebook interview process](https://interviewing.io/blog/google-facebook-hiring-freeze). To wit, here is a graph of mock interviews on our platform with Facebook and Google engineers, by week. As you can see, we\u2019re definitely incentivized to care about what\u2019s actually going on with these freezes.\n\n![Chart showing Google and Facebook mock interviews on interviewing.io by week](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffacebook_google_mock_interviews_6f9e02e555.png&w=2048&q=75 \"Chart showing Google and Facebook mock interviews\")\n\nNote that though our user base isn\u2019t a perfectly representative sample of engineers interviewing at Google and Facebook, we have reason to believe that it\u2019s reasonably representative. We\u2019ve been around for about 7 years, have hosted over 100K technical interviews on our platform (split between mock interviews and real ones), and thousands of engineers sign up to use interviewing.io every month. Our average user has 7 years of experience, and about 40% of our users either currently work or have worked at a FAANG company.\n\n## Our survey\n\nOur survey went out to users on July 23rd and got 1003 responses (mostly between July 23rd and July 25th). There were a bunch of questions, but here are the 3 most relevant ones:\n\n![Survey question: Are you currently actively interviewing with any of the following companies?](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsurvey_question_one_1024x789_c325e2022a.png&w=1080&q=75 \"Question #1\")\n\n![Survey question: For each of the companies you mentioned in the previous question, which level are you applying for (e.g. L5, E6, etc?](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsurvey_question_two_1024x317_9faf480a7a.png&w=1080&q=75 \"Question #2\")\n\n![Survey question: For the comapnies you mentioned in the previous question, are you appying for SWE/SDE roles or something more niche?](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsurvey_question_three_1024x515_979811f9f2.png&w=1080&q=75 \"Question #3\")\n\n## The results\n\nAs mentioned above, we had 1003 people fill out the survey. Here\u2019s what we learned.\n\n- Respondents were primarily based in the US with an average of 6 years of experience (median of 5).\n- 48% were actively interviewing (way more than we expected, given all the recession talk)\n- These are the companies where they were actively interviewing (percents below won\u2019t add up to a 100 because respondents could select as many options as they liked):\n\n![Screenshot of survey results](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fhiring_freeze_059e455d0f.png&w=1080&q=75 \"Hiring Freeze\")\n\nI wasn\u2019t surprised to see Amazon at the top of the list, given that they haven\u2019t announced freezes and are [continuing to aggressively hire engineers](https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-to-hire-more-tech-corporate-workers-in-california-hubs/623167/).[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n\nI *was* surprised that, despite their 2-week freeze announcement, Google was right at the top as well. Given that Facebook had supposedly been frozen for a while, I was surprised to see them in 3rd position.\n\nSo, we dug into the data for Google and Facebook specifically.\n\n## What\u2019s going on with Google and Facebook?\n\n### Facebook\n\nFacebook first [announced their hiring freeze on May 4th](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-is-freezing-hiring-heres-why-and-who-it-impacts-2022-5). Though the announcement made it clear that the engineering org would be affected, it didn\u2019t go into detail. Of course, around the time that the freeze was announced, commentary about the freeze also started popping up on Blind ([like this one](https://www.teamblind.com/browse/Facebook-Hiring-396)). Consistently from thread to thread, it looked like Facebook froze hiring for engineers below E7, with the exception of Machine Learning Engineers, whom Facebook continued to hire, at all levels.\n\nBased on what we learned from the 76 survey respondents who were actively in process with Facebook, it does appear that SWE below E7 is indeed frozen, but there are some eng functions that are still hiring, in addition to Machine Learning.\n\n| Facebook roles frozen | Facebook roles NOT frozen |\n| --- | --- |\n| SWE below E7 | E7+ SWEs |\n|  | Machine Learning Engineers |\n|  | Production Engineers (devops and/or SRE) |\n|  | Enterprise Engineers (work on Facebook\u2019s internal tools & systems; have  their own hiring process distinct from SWE) |\n|  | Managerial tracks, including M1 (some sources had said that hiring was  frozen at M1 but active for M2 and up) |\n\nWe did one other test as a sanity check. What if Facebook was using the hiring freeze as a smoke screen and only continuing with the absolute strongest candidates while keeping the rest on the bench?\n\nOur best insight into candidate ability is how they perform in interviews on our platform (we do both mock interviews and real ones and have hosted over 100K interviews to date). On interviewing.io, every user who\u2019s done at least 2 mock interviews has a score, and this score is a weighted average of coding ability, problem solving ability, and communication on a scale from 0 to 1. We use it internally to figure out who the strongest performers are so we can best match them with companies.\n\nFirst, we grabbed the overall mean score on interviewing.io, across all users. Then we compared that mean to the mean scores of people who were still interviewing at Facebook. There wasn\u2019t a statistically significant difference. In other words, from what we know, Facebook probably isn\u2019t using their hiring freeze as a smoke screen.\n\n*Do you have reliable info that any of the above is incorrect? Email me at [aline@interviewing.io](mailto:aline@interviewing.io).*\n\n### Google\n\nFirst off, Google is supposedly going to announce whether the two-week freeze is going to continue, and if so, on what terms, on August 3rd. So there\u2019s a good chance this post will age poorly!\n\nThat said, I\u2019m a firm believer in marching on with the information we have at the time, so here goes\u2026\n\nAnalyzing Facebook was fairly straightforward because with the exception of a few new pieces of information (e.g. Production Engineering is still hiring), what was in the press and on Blind was consistent with reality. Figuring out what was going on at Google, on the other hand, was a harder task.\n\nGoogle first [announced their hiring freeze on July 20th](https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/20/23271634/google-hiring-pause-two-weeks-review-headcount-needs), following an announcement that hiring would slow for the rest of 2022 but that headcount would remain open in critical roles, including engineering. A Google spokesperson then clarified that over these 2 weeks, Google would be pausing \u201cmost offers\u201d.\n\nIn our survey, 210 people were actively in process with Google. That seemed high, so I reached out to all of them to get their take on what was going on and to confirm that they were indeed actively in process and not in nebulously waiting for some next step that may or may not come.\n\nThe results were fascinating. First, here\u2019s what appears to be true across the board:\n\n- Google is indeed not extending offers throughout the duration of the freeze. In other words, there are people in various stages of interviews, but even if they get past the hiring committee, they wouldn\u2019t get an official offer until the freeze is lifted.\n- L3 or \u201cearly career\u201d hiring is indeed frozen until next year. Almost everyone who responded to us and had been interviewing for L3 was paused. That said, it looks like Google is willing to continue L3 interviews in some cases with the understanding that those results will be valid for a year, so that when headcount for L3 opens up again, candidates will be able to skip the onsite process.\n\nThe rest is\u2026 murky. From what I can tell, different recruiters are telling people different things. Here\u2019s a sample.\n\n> *I asked my Google recruiter the situation with Google hiring, and they confirmed that for at least L3 Early Career SWE, there [is no headcount] left for 2022\u2026. They also said that other positions (L4+) are still actively hiring.*\n\n> *I just received a phone call from the Google recruiter yesterday. She said that they are slowing down hiring for \u201cearly career\u201d developers, which are L3 and L4, for the rest of the year, but higher levels are still in full swing.*\n\n> *I just had a conversation with the recruiter and they HAVE a hiring freeze until Aug 3rd, but they didn\u2019t stop the interviewing and team matching process.*\n\n> *I am currently in a freeze mode with them. I was in the team matching process and after several hiring manager\u2019s interviews, they came to me with the news to wait until they reprioritize stuff.*\n\n> *Google is hiring in full swing\u2026 Their engineering teams are going to move people around in two weeks to fill some of the open roles but that\u2019ll not affect much in hiring.*\n\n> So, according to their response to me, I \u201cmay experience some delays in our hiring process\u201d [but] I was specifically told that the hiring process is not halted with me.\n\n> *I\u2019m in process still, but they said that even if I do well on the interview I [will] not receive an offer until the hiring slowdown ends.*\n\nAs several of these statements blatantly contradict one another, I went back to the data and ran the same sanity check that I did with Facebook above. In other words, what if Google is using the hiring freeze as a smoke screen and only continuing with the strongest candidates, while keeping the rest on the bench?\n\nAs above, our best insight into candidate ability is how they perform in interviews on our platform (see the Facebook section above for an explanation of our scoring system and our approach).\n\nJust like in the Facebook analysis, we grabbed the overall mean score on interviewing.io, across all users. Then, we compared that mean to the mean scores of Google interviewees, this time *at various levels* (L4, L5, and L6). Unlike the Facebook analysis, we did see some statistical significance at L4. Candidates who were still actively interviewing at L4 had significantly higher interviewing.io scores than the average interviewing.io candidate (p < 0.03 with a \u201cmedium\u201d effect size of 0.45). We did NOT see any significance for candidates at L5 and above.\n\nNote that we don\u2019t have a nice, clean table in this section where we show what\u2019s frozen and not, like we did for Facebook, precisely because the results were murky. It feels like Facebook made a clear set of rules and then stuck to them and communicated them effectively to candidates. With Google, it feels like decisions are being made on a case-by-case basis. That said, from this running the numbers and interacting with our users, here\u2019s what we *think* is going on.\n\n- L4 is partially frozen, but allowances/exceptions are possibly being made for interview performance \u2013 if someone interviews well, then they\u2019re being moved forward, to onsite and to hiring committee. Others are being paused. It\u2019s about half and half for L4 (see the graph below). Note that this is quite presumptive, and I don\u2019t have a lot of conviction around it, but given the data we have, it\u2019s a reasonable conclusion.\n\n![Chart showing that Google appears to be selectively applying their hiring freeze, depending on level](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FGoogle_appears_to_be_selectively_applying_their_hiring_freeze_depending_on_level_811c48f4c3.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Google continue to interview candidates\")\n\n- Unlike L4, L5 and up are actively hiring almost across the board, regardless of performance.\n- Machine Learning, Technical Program Manager, and Engineering Manager roles are actively hiring across the board.\n\n*Do you have reliable info that any of the above is incorrect? Email me at [aline@interviewing.io](mailto:aline@interviewing.io).*\n\n## Limitations and conclusion\n\nAfter running the numbers and talking to our users, it appears that Facebook eng hiring is largely frozen, with some key exceptions. Google, on the other hand, has frozen extending offers for 2 weeks but is still actively interviewing candidates, except for junior ones, sometimes making decisions about whom to interview and whom to pause on a case-by-case basis. We\u2019ll know more about the Google situation in a few days, once the 2 weeks period runs out.\n\nGiven that both companies are clearly prioritizing senior eng roles, we shipped something we hope will help. On interviewing.io, you can now choose to practice specifically with a Staff-level (or above) engineer from Google or Facebook. If you\u2019re still in process, and especially if you\u2019re interviewing for L6/E6 or above, this is a direct line to the best-calibrated, most experienced interviewer you can get.\n\nWhether you use us to practice or not, these are uncertain times, and there\u2019s a lot of bad information out there. With this post, we tried to offset it by reporting on what we\u2019ve learned from primary sources, our users who are/were actively interviewing at both Google and Facebook. While I can count on one hand (maybe both?) the limitations to our approach (e.g. our scoring system being inaccurate, sampling bias, people not being honest in their survey responses, not enough data, us failing to analyze certain attributes of candidates, and more), when things are uncertain and you have limited information, you have to do the best you can with what you\u2019ve got.\n\nThis analysis started as an internal exercise to help us get some predictability around our usage and our revenue. Then as I started working on it, I realized that people outside of interviewing.io might want to see it too. So I hope you, dear reader, will forgive us our data trespasses and know that we did this work with the best intention in mind \u2013 combating misinformation and getting our best attempt at the truth out there.\n\n*If you have reliable information that contradicts what you\u2019ve read in this post, please get in touch with me ([aline@interviewing.io](mailto:aline@interviewing.io)). I commit to making edits as I learn new things. Finally, a huge thank you to everyone who filled out our survey and answered my annoying followup questions.*\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1.

Part 1.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: July 23, 2024; Last updated: October 28, 2024\n\n*In this post (part 1 of 2), we\u2019ll share some data about which channels are most effective for getting into the door at great companies and why. In [part 2](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-to-get-in-the-door-at-top-companies-cold-out-reach-to-hiring-managers-part-2), we get very tactical and tell you exactly what to say and do to get responses.*\n\ninterviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform \u2014 we help engineers prepare for technical interviews by pairing them with senior FAANG and FAANG-adjacent engineers for mock interviews and feedback. In this market, many of our users are struggling with getting in the door at companies, so we ran a survey to see what\u2019s worked well for our users and what hasn\u2019t, in today\u2019s difficult climate.\n\nIn our survey, we gave people the following channels for getting into companies and asked them which were the most and least effective:\n\n- In-house recruiters contact you\n- Apply online\n- Warm referrals\n- Cold referrals\n- Cold outreach to hiring managers\n- Cold outreach to recruiters\n- Agency recruiters contact you\n\nWe also asked them which types of companies they got responses from:\n\n- FAANG\n- FAANG-adjacent (e.g., Stripe, Dropbox, OpenAI, Uber)\n- Large startups\n- Small startups\n\nWe got ~500 responses. Among survey respondents, which channels were most effective was largely consistent, regardless of company type, but there were some twists depending on who the candidates were. More on that in a bit.\n\nBelow are the channels, ranked by effectiveness.[1](#user-content-fn-1) When more people found a channel effective than ineffective, it ended up in the first list. When more people found a channel to be ineffective than effective, it ended up on the second list.\n\n**Recruiting channels that our users found to be effective (ranked from most to least effective):**\n\n- Warm referrals\n- In-house recruiters contact you\n- Apply online\n- Cold outreach to hiring managers\n\n**Recruiting channels that our users found to be ineffective (ranked from least to most ineffective):**\n\n- Cold outreach to recruiters\n- Cold referrals (referrals from people you don\u2019t know)\n- Agency recruiters contact you\n\nThis data came primarily from surveying experienced engineers (4+ years), rather than juniors (we don\u2019t have that many juniors on our platform; average years of experience is 8). If you\u2019re a junior engineer in this market, you already know you\u2019re in for a tough time, and we\u2019d advise you to take your destiny into your own hands as much as possible by reaching out directly to hiring managers (the same advice we give many of our more experienced users). More on that later in the post.\n\nInterestingly, these results were quite consistent between company types. In other words, channels that worked well for FAANGs tended to work well for startups and vice versa.\n\nOverall, the most useful channels were in-house recruiters (when they reached out to you) and warm referrals. Unfortunately, both of these channels are somewhat out of your control. You have very little control over whether internal recruiters reach out to you. There are *some* things you can do to increase the chances, but they\u2019re all tied up in your work history and identity, neither of which you can easily change. We\u2019ll talk more about that later on.\n\nWarm referrals (i.e., referrals from people you know), on the other hand, are very useful and are a *bit* more in your control, but they still depend on the quality of your network.\n\nBelow is a diagram comparing the utility of all the channels to how much control you have over them.\n\n![A diagram comparing the effectiveness and utility of all the recruitment/hiring channels to how much control you have over them.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/effectiveness_and_utility_quadrant_for_channels_1c6bec37f1.png)\n\nYou might wonder why we speculatively singled out cold outreach to hiring managers as something that can be done right, versus the other channels. In our experience, that channel is both misused and underutilized and is the best bet for many candidates, provided they do it correctly. In our next post, we\u2019ll tell you exactly what to do and what to say when you reach out to hiring managers \u2014 especially if you come from a non-traditional background and aren\u2019t getting a lot of recruiter outreach/don\u2019t have the network to get warm referrals, reaching out to hiring managers is your absolute best bet.\nNow let\u2019s look at each channel in detail.\n\n### In-house recruiters contact you\n\nThis channel is one of the two where you have the least amount of control (the other is agency recruiters contacting you, though that one is way less useful).\n\nSo, how much control do you have over this channel? One bit of analysis we did on our survey data was to try to find patterns in the background of people who find in-house recruiters particularly useful. Not too surprisingly, some patterns did emerge.\n\nIn-house recruiters are most likely to contact you if:\n\n- You look good on paper, i.e., you have top-tier companies and/or schools on your resume (in our experience, companies matter more)\n- You belong to a group that\u2019s been traditionally underrepresented in tech (i.e., you\u2019re a woman or a person of color)\n- To *some* extent, though less than the two bullets above, if you have niche skills (e.g., ML engineering)\n\nThese results aren\u2019t unique to just this survey. We [recently did a study](https://interviewing.io/blog/are-recruiters-better-than-a-coin-flip-at-judging-resumes) where we asked a bunch of recruiters to look at resumes and tell us which candidates they\u2019d want to interview. While the intent of the study was to see if recruiters are good at identifying talent (spoiler: they were barely better than a coin flip), we learned some other interesting things, including what recruiters actually look for when they read a resume.\n\nThe two most sought-after resume traits were: 1) experience at a top-tier tech company (FAANG or FAANG-adjacent) and 2) URM (underrepresented minority) status (in tech, this means being Black or Hispanic).\n\nThis mirrored what we saw in our user survey when we looked at commonalities among candidates who got value from in-house recruiters.\n\nSo how do you use this information to your advantage? You obviously can\u2019t magic FAANG/FAANG-adjacent experience or URM status out of thin air[2](#user-content-fn-2), but if you do have either, our pragmatic advice is to highlight it and make it really easy for recruiters to spot. Of course, whether you *want* to lead with URM status is a personal decision. We\u2019ve heard differing opinions on this and are not here to judge. All we can do is share the data \u2014 do with it what you will.\n\nSo, how do you make sure that, say, your FAANG experience stands out to recruiters? Take a look at the before and after screenshots of the resume below[3](#user-content-fn-3). This resume belongs to one of our users who was kind enough to let us share it. He actually has two of the three things that recruiters look for: FAANG experience and a niche title (ML engineer). But both are buried! And the section that gets the most attention is wasted on undergraduate awards.\n\n#### Before\n\n![Before version of a resume from one of interviewing.io's users](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/resume_before_b8d5aa1c34.png)\n\nAs you can see, he spent almost 3 years at Apple, but a recruiter skimming his resume might not notice that because it was a while ago. Instead, he showcases an undergrad award and some technologies/languages that he knows. Neither of those is nearly as useful to recruiters as FAANG experience.\n\nHis current title is also ML engineer, and one at the Principal level at that. But it wasn\u2019t always: He went from back-end to SRE to a little bit of everything to ML, and because of that, it\u2019s possible a recruiter would miss it as well.\n\n![After version of a resume from one of interviewing.io's users](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/resume_after_c148ae3b62.png)\n\nWe edited this candidate\u2019s resume to put all the things recruiters look for at the very top of the resume and moved the buzzword soup to the bottom. This candidate is obviously well-positioned because he has FAANG experience, several top schools, and niche skills \u2014 but before, many recruiters didn\u2019t spot them. After he made these changes, the number of interviews he got increased by 8X.\n\n### Apply online\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever applied to jobs online, then you know it\u2019s kind of like screaming into a black hole. Though, according to our survey, some candidates (specifically people applying to FAANG/FAANG-adjacent companies and small startups) get some value out of this channel, it\u2019s still a numbers game. And for large startups, it\u2019s a losing proposition.\n\nAccording to recruiting tool Gem, applicants that come from recruiter outreach (called \u201coutbound\u201d in recruiter lingo) are [6 - 10X more likely to get hired](https://www.gem.com/blog/outbound-candidates-more-likely-to-be-hired) than applicants who apply online (called \u201cinbound\u201d).\n\nAs Lyft recruiting manager Nate Wylie put it:\n\n> Our data\u2026 showed higher pass-through rates for candidates [we reached out to] at each stage of the interview process vs. applicants via the careers page. It\u2019s not that we want to ignore applicants; it\u2019s just that historically we don\u2019t get what we\u2019re looking for \u2014 and with speed \u2014 through that channel.\n\nHaving been a recruiter myself, I can confirm that many companies do indeed ignore their online careers page. Many years ago, when I first joined the recruiting team at a top-tier startup, I spent my first few days going through the resumes of people who had applied online. I found a treasure trove of candidates, including very experienced applicants from top-tier companies.[4](#user-content-fn-4) But no one had seen these applicants because no one had been monitoring inbound activity for months!\n\nThe silver lining here is that when you don\u2019t hear back from a company (or even when you get an automatic rejection email wishing you \"the best in your future endeavors\"), it\u2019s not because a human looked at your resume and made a deliberate, thoughtful decision about you. It\u2019s tempting to think that way because it plays so well into our insecurities. The reality is that a human probably never saw your resume in the first place.\n\nSo why do people apply online, despite knowing in their gut that it\u2019s not an effective strategy? Simply put, it\u2019s predictable and easy. You get into a routine, you upload your resume, you connect your LinkedIn, and you can knock out hundreds of applications in a matter of hours.\n\nThe other encouraging thing about this channel is that, when we analyzed specifically which types of candidates had success with it, we couldn\u2019t find any patterns \u2014 the channel worked equally well (poorly?) for people who looked good on paper vs. not, and there was no preferential treatment for traditionally underrepresented groups in tech (e.g., women and people of color).\n\n**TL;DR Applying online doesn\u2019t hurt\u2026 provided that you don\u2019t take rejection personally. If you do, it\u2019ll wear you down over time.**\n\n### Warm referrals\n\nWarm referrals are, of course, excellent. That is, assuming it's a *real* referral \u2014 someone who can actually vouch for you, and ideally your work.\n\nPer capita, referrals are most companies\u2019 best source of candidates, and they were a great channel for our users across all company types (they were the best channel for FAANGs/FAANG-adjacents, as well as large startups, and second best for small startups, behind in-house recruiters reaching out).\n\nIf you have the network, you should absolutely use it. Of course, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll have meaningful connections at every company you want to work at. What do you do then?\n\n### Cold referrals\n\nShould you ask people you don't know to refer you? Our survey data says probably not. Cold referrals were net negative for both FAANG and small startups and neutral for large startups.\n\nYears ago, trying to collect cold referrals was a decent strategy. You could track down someone at the company and ask them to toss your proverbial hat into the ring\n\nEngineers were often happy to refer someone \u2014 even someone they didn't know \u2014 either to be kind, to avoid the awkwardness of declining, or to collect the potential referral bonus. They couldn't vouch for you, but the referral would ensure that a human looked at your resume.\n\nThis became so common that Blind actually spun out an entire referral marketplace called [Rooftop Slushie](https://theamericangenius.com/adj/rooftop-slushie/) (the link is to some press because the actual site is now defunct), where applicants would pay a small sum for a referral.\n\nThen, companies wised up and realized that these referrals weren't all that different from normal in-bound applicants. So why treat them differently?\nMany companies nowadays separate referrals into \"true referrals\" and \"leads.\" It\u2019s great for maintaining the delicate dance of social dynamics, but it\u2019s completely useless for getting hired \u2014 dropping someone\u2019s resume into the \u201cleads\u201d pile is basically the same as throwing it into the inbound black hole.\n\nGiven that cold referrals aren\u2019t zero effort, our advice is to expend that energy elsewhere. More on that shortly.\n\n### Agency recruiters\n\nAgency recruiters were the worst channel overall, according to our survey, and were net negative for all company types.\n\nFAANGs and FAANG-adjacent companies tend to rely less on agencies than startups, and when they do, it\u2019s to fill some very specific need (rather than \u201cHey we need more SWEs\u201d), so it\u2019s not surprising that our users didn\u2019t get much value from this channel when applying to FAANGs.\n\nWhile both large and small startups use agencies liberally, clearly the value to candidates is limited.[5](#user-content-fn-5) Out of all of our survey respondents, only a handful of our users said that agencies were useful to them, and of those who mentioned agencies, the majority said that they were the worst channel.\n\nWe won\u2019t belabor the point, but it\u2019s probably not in your best interest to spend much time on working with agency recruiters. It has opportunity cost and not much upside. And you can [routinely get screwed in salary negotiations when you work with an agency recruiter](https://interviewing.io/blog/sabotage-salary-negotiation-before-even-start), if you even get that far.\n\n### Cold outreach (to hiring managers vs. recruiters)\n\nNot all cold outreach is created equal, for two reasons. First, there\u2019s your audience: hiring managers vs. recruiters. And then there\u2019s the quality of the outreach itself. We\u2019ll come back to how to write the kinds of messages that will get you responses. First, let\u2019s talk about the audience.\n\nYou can see in our survey results that cold outreach to hiring managers was net positive for FAANG/FAANG-adjacent companies and neutral for the other company types. Cold outreach to recruiters, on the other hand, was net negative for both FAANG/FAANG-adjacents and small startups and neutral for large startups.\n\nIgnoring the quality of the outreach for a moment, which we expect is probably comparable for both types, why does this difference exist?\n\nIf you had to answer the question of who\u2019s the right person to reach out to about jobs, your gut instinct might be to say it\u2019s recruiters. After all, hiring is officially their job! However, that\u2019s not strictly true. Recruiters are not incentivized to make hires, at least not directly. Just like everyone else, recruiters\u2019 main priority is to keep their jobs.\n\n#### Cold outreach to recruiters doesn\u2019t work\n\nHow does a recruiter keep their job?[6](#user-content-fn-6) By *bringing in the types of candidates that their manager tasked them with*. How is that different from hiring? Hiring implies that you\u2019re evaluated on whether the people you bring in actually get hired, but most in-house recruiters aren\u2019t evaluated this way\u2026 because it takes too long.\n\nInstead, recruiters are sometimes evaluated on what portion of their candidates get offers or get to onsite. However, because of drop-off and latency (getting an offer can still take months), your organization has to be pretty good at tracking. Many are not.\n\nAs such, many recruiting orgs prefer simpler, faster metrics:\n\n- Of the candidates you reached out to, how many responded?\n- Of those who responded, how many resulted in a first conversation?\n\nThe downside of measuring success in a single part of the funnel is that you don\u2019t incentivize people to care about what happens downstream (that is, how many are hired). This would be like if marketers only paid attention to ad clicks, rather than actual purchases. But that\u2019s how recruiting operates: individuals aren\u2019t really incentivized to care what happens downstream.\n\nSo, if you are typically just measuring the response rates of your reports, as a recruiting manager, you have to set some guardrails for the types of candidates that you want your team to reach out to. If you don\u2019t, they\u2019ll end up just reaching out to people who are likely to respond instead of people who are a good fit for the job.\n\nUnfortunately, you don\u2019t know who is a good fit for the job. You can\u2019t just say, \u201cGo on LinkedIn, and find me good engineers.\u201d\n\n![Screenshot of LinkedIn search](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Flinkedin_can_code_8178d2dc43.png&w=640&q=75 \"LinkedIn search\")\n\nThat doesn\u2019t exist. So instead, you come up with some rules that look like this:\n\n- Senior engineers\n  - Juniors and intermediate engineers would answer outreach a lot, but they already apply online in droves, so we don\u2019t need to pay people to go out and find them. Moreover, we have a whole university department that deals with college hires once a year in September.\n- Went to a top school (in the absence of a better filter, this works OK)\n- Worked at a top company\n\nThere may be a few other items on the list if the role requires specific skills (e.g., Android development), but by and large, that\u2019s what recruiters are tasked with, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re focused on.\n\nIt seems counterintuitive, but if you\u2019re either fairly junior (fewer than 4 years of experience) or you don\u2019t have fancy brands and schools on your resume, recruiters are not incentivized to help you because you don\u2019t meet their criteria, and they\u2019re not incentivized to take risks on candidates because they\u2019re not getting rewarded when the company makes hires (or punished when the company doesn\u2019t).\n\n**What does this mean for you? If you\u2019re not the type of candidate that recruiters are reaching out to already (senior, well-pedigreed), they will not help you.**\n\nWith that sad reality in mind, here\u2019s the good news: there *is* someone who\u2019s actually incentivized to make hires and is much more open-minded: the hiring manager[7](#user-content-fn-7)!\n\n#### Cold outreach to hiring managers is effective\n\nAt this point, you might be skeptical. After all, according to the graph comparing all channels, hiring manager outreach is the worst of the best. Sure, it\u2019s net positive for FAANG/FAANG-adjacent companies, but it lags behind in-house recruiters, warm referrals, and online applications with respect to effectiveness.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Hiring manager outreach is the channel with the most untapped potential for effectiveness, while also being the one where you have the most control. Because companies often ignore them, online applications can\u2019t come close to the same level of control, and warm referrals have a low ceiling. In-house recruiter outreach is largely out of your control (except for maybe making some limited profile tweaks, as we saw above).\n\nWhy is this the right channel?\n\nUnlike recruiters, hiring managers are actually incentivized to make hires and tend to be more open-minded about candidate backgrounds, all because hiring managers are judged on results. Specifically, they\u2019re judged on how quickly and effectively they\u2019re able to build stuff, and are \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 incentivized to grow headcount. For hiring managers, it\u2019s not about the appearance of doing the work. It\u2019s about the cold, hard reality of whether the work got done. And because they\u2019re judged on actually getting stuff done, hiring managers are also much more incentivized than recruiters to take risks.\n\nOutside of needing more people to build things, hiring managers are also incentivized to hire for their teams because the better they are at recruiting and filling headcount, the more likely they are to get promoted.\n\nAs such, in our minds, when people say that hiring manager outreach hasn\u2019t worked for them, it\u2019s because they\u2019re not doing it right. So, how do you do it?\n\nIn our next post, we\u2019ll get very practical about outreach, provide a bunch of examples of good and bad outreach, and share two templates that you can steal.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. First, here\u2019s how we got to these rankings. We asked each engineer who took our survey to rank all the channels they used to get in the door, from best to worst. Then we tallied up the points (+1 for best two channels, -1 for worst two). We didn\u2019t do a more granular point system (e.g., +2 and -2) because the difference between the top two channels wasn\u2019t always 2X, and generally, from talking to our users, preferences were somewhat muddy. As such, these results are directionally correct, but we didn\u2019t feel comfortable numerically comparing them to one another. Finally, we divided the total tally by the number of times that channel came up. As a result, we were able to rank channels from most effective to least effective. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n2. This is why I generally view resume writers as selling snake oil. Either you have the things recruiters are looking for or you don\u2019t. If you don\u2019t, no amount of wordsmithing your bullet points or reorganizing the page is going to make a significant difference. Sure, [check your resume for typos](https://blog.alinelerner.com/lessons-from-a-years-worth-of-hiring-data/), and make sure that it reads decently well. Any more time invested in your resume after those basic things will have diminishing returns. Beware of anyone who tells you otherwise, and beware of any products or services who charge for resume review. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-2)\n3. We realize that recruiters won\u2019t always have access to your resume when doing outreach and are likely looking at your LinkedIn instead. The same advice stands. Make sure that your About section has all the most important tidbits about you, front and center. Also, even though we didn\u2019t see the same strong preference for FAANGs and URM status when applying online (more on that in the next section), making these types of changes to your resume certainly won\u2019t hurt. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-3)\n4. Of course we don\u2019t share the point of view that you can only be a good candidate if you have a brand-name company on your resume. However, many recruiters do, and they are still ignoring this channel. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-4)\n5. We\u2019d argue that the value to companies is limited as well. Though there are a handful of excellent agency recruiters out there, most are terrible. The hard thing is that, as an employer, you can\u2019t immediately tell who\u2019s terrible, and you end up wasting a bunch of time reviewing profiles of candidates who might look promising on the surface, but because of selection bias (these are the people who decided to work with bad agency recruiters, after all) are not a fit. That or they\u2019re not interested in your company (and have possibly never even opted in to talk to you) or both. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-5)\n6. At larger companies, recruiting is usually split into two functions: sourcing (these are the people who reach out to candidates) and recruiting (these are the people who manage candidates\u2019 journey through the process and extend offers). In this post, for simplicity, we\u2019re lumping them together because separating them out would change some of the details but wouldn\u2019t change the key takeaways. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-6)\n7. Note that if you\u2019re interested in smaller startups (Series A and below), you can substitute \u201cfounder\u201d for \u201chiring manager\u201d in the steps below. Founders are the most incentivized to get shit done and take risks, regardless of company size and stage, but at larger startups, they may be less likely to read cold emails because they get bombarded with all manners of requests and sales pitches. At a Series B or C company or at public companies with fewer than, say, 3000 employees, in addition to hiring managers, you should also target Directors and VPs \u2014 they have the power to get things done and aren\u2019t so far removed from feeling the pain of not filling roles that making an extra hire or two is out of their purview. At large public companies, targeting Directors and above doesn\u2019t make much sense \u2014 they ARE too far removed from doing the work to make individual hires. If you do contact them, the best outcome is that they\u2019ll pass you on to one of their direct reports. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-7)\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

We looked at thousands of real interviews to find out.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: November 28, 2017; Last updated: July 13, 2023\n\nAt interviewing.io, we\u2019ve analyzed and written at some depth about what makes for a good interview from the perspective of an interviewee. However, despite the inherent power imbalance, interviewing is a two-way street. I wrote a while ago about how, in this market, [recruiting isn\u2019t about vetting as much as it is about selling](http://blog.alinelerner.com/building-a-product-in-the-technical-recruiting-space-read-this-first/), and not engaging candidates in the course of talking to them for an hour is a woefully missed opportunity. But, just like solving interview questions is a learned skill that takes time and practice, so, too, is the other side of the table. Being a good interviewer takes time and effort and a fundamental willingness to get out of autopilot and engage meaningfully with the other person.\n\nOf course, everyone and their uncle has strong opinions about what makes someone a good interviewer, so instead of waxing philosophical, we\u2019ll present some data and focus on analytically answering questions like\u2026 Does it matter how strong of an engineering brand your company has, for instance? Do the questions you ask actually help get candidates excited? How important is it to give good hints to your candidate? How much should you talk about yourself? And is it true that, at the end of the day, what you say is way less important than how you make people feel?[1](#user-content-fn-1) And so on.\n\nBefore I delve into our findings, I\u2019ll say a few words about interviewing.io and the data we collect.\n\n## The setup\n\n[interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/) is an anonymous technical interviewing platform. On interviewing.io, people can practice technical interviewing anonymously, and if things go well, unlock real (still anonymous) interviews with companies like Lyft, Twitch, Quora, and more.\n\nThe cool thing is that both practice and real interviews with companies take place within the interviewing.io ecosystem. As a result, we\u2019re able to collect quite a bit of interview data and analyze it to better understand technical interviewing. One of the most important pieces of data we collect is feedback from both the interviewer and interviewee about how they thought the interview went and what they thought of each other. If you\u2019re curious, you can watch a real interview on our [recordings](https://interviewing.io/mocks) page, and see what the feedback forms for interviewers and interviewees look like below \u2014 in addition to one direct yes/no question, we also ask about a few different aspects of interview performance using a 1-4 scale. We also ask interviewees some extra questions that we don\u2019t share with their interviewers, one of which is their own take on how they thought they did.\n\n![Screenshot of the interviewing.io interview feedback form for interviewers](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5a595_screenshot_2017_11_29_09_13_30_6712d25e2a.png&w=1200&q=75 \"Interviewing.io interview feedback form for interviewers\")\n\nInterviewer feedback form\n\n\n\n![Screenshot of the interviewing.io interview feedback form for interviewees](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F9fb48_screenshot_2017_11_29_09_02_07_7d4a011c3d.png&w=1080&q=75 \"Interviewing.io interview feedback form for interviewees\")\n\nInterviewee feedback form\n\nIn this post, we\u2019ll be analyzing feedback and outcomes of thousands of real interviews with companies to figure out what traits [the best interviewers](https://interviewing.io/blog/our-business-depends-on-having-the-best-interviewers-so-we-built-an-interviewer-rating-system-and-you-can-too) have in common.\n\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty of individual interviewer behaviors, let\u2019s first put the value of a good interviewer in context by looking at the impact of a company\u2019s brand on the outcome. After all, if brand matters a lot, then maybe being a good interviewer isn\u2019t as important as we might think.\n\n## Brand strength\n\nSo, does brand really matter for interview outcomes? One quick caveat before we get into the data: every interview on the platform is user-initiated. In other words, once you unlock our jobs portal (you have to do really well in practice interviews to do so), you decide who you talk to. So, candidates talking to companies on our platform will be predisposed to move forward because they\u2019ve chosen the company in the first place. And, as should come as no surprise to anyone, companies with a very strong brand have an easier time pulling candidates (on our platform and out in the world at large) than their lesser-known counterparts. Moreover, many of the companies we work with do have a pretty strong brand, so our pool isn\u2019t representative of the entire branding landscape. However, all is not lost \u2014 in addition to working with very recognizable brands, we work with a number of small, up-and-coming startups, so we hope that if you, the reader, are coming from a company that\u2019s doing cool stuff but that hasn\u2019t yet become a household name, our findings likely apply to you. And, as you\u2019ll see, getting candidates in the door isn\u2019t the same as keeping them.\n\nTo try to quantify brand strength, we used three different measures: the company\u2019s [Klout Score](https://klout.com/corp/score) (yes, that still exists), its Mattermark [Mindshare Score](https://mattermark.com/first-official-company-rankings-update/#:~:text=The%20Mindshare%20Score%20is%20the,gain%20and%20retain%20attention%20online), and its score on [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/index.htm) (under general reviews).[2](#user-content-fn-2)\n\nWhen we looked at interview outcomes relative to brand strength, its impact was not statistically significant. In other words, **we found that brand strength didn\u2019t matter at all when it came to either whether the candidate wanted to move forward or how excited the candidate was to work at the company**.\n\nThis was a bit surprising, so I decided to dig deeper. Maybe brand strength doesn\u2019t matter overall but matters when the interviewer or the questions they asked aren\u2019t highly rated? In other words, can brand buttress less-than-stellar interviewers? Not so, according to our data. Brand didn\u2019t matter even when you corrected for interviewer quality. In fact, of the top 10 best-rated companies on our platform, half have no brand to speak of, 3 are mid-sized YC companies that command respect in Bay Area circles but are definitely not universally recognizable, and only 2 have anything approaching household name status.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the takeaway here? **Maybe the most realistic thing we can say is that while brand likely matters *a lot* for getting candidates in the door, once they\u2019re in, no matter how well-branded you are, they\u2019re yours to lose.**\n\n## Choosing the interview question\n\nIf brand doesn\u2019t matter once you\u2019ve actually gotten a candidate in the door, then what does? Turns out, the questions you ask matter a TON. As you recall, feedback on interviewing.io is symmetric, which means that in addition to the interviewer rating the candidate, the candidate also rates the interviewer, and one of the things we ask candidates is how good the question(s) they got asked were.\n\n**Question quality was extremely significant (p < 0.002 with an effect size of 1.25) when it came to whether the candidate wanted to move forward with the company. This held both when candidates did well and when they did poorly.**\n\nWhile we obviously can\u2019t share the best questions (these are company interviews, after all), we can look at what candidates had to say about the best and worst-rated questions on the platform.\n\n### The good\n\n> *Always nice to get questions that are more than just plain algorithms.*\n\n> *Really good asking of a classic question, opened my mind up to edge cases and considerations that I never contemplated the couple of times I\u2019ve been exposed to the internals of this data structure.*\n\n> *This was the longest interviewing.io interview I have ever done, and it is also the most enjoyable one! I really like how we started with a simple data structure and implemented algorithms on top of it. It felt like working on a simple small-scale project and was fun.*\n\n> *He chose an interesting and challenging interview problem that made me feel like I was learning while I was solving it. I can\u2019t think of any improvements. He would be great to work with.*\n\n> *I liked the question \u2014 it takes a relatively simple algorithms problem (build and traverse a tree) and adds some depth. I also liked that the interviewer connected the problem to a real product at [Redacted] which made it feel like less like a toy problem and more like a pared-down version of a real problem.*\n\n> *This is my favorite question that I\u2019ve encountered on this site. it was one of the only ones that seem like it had actual real-life applicability and was drawn from a real (or potentially real) business challenge. And it also nicely wove in challenges like complexity, efficiency, and blocking.*\n\n### The bad\n\n> *Question wasn\u2019t straightforward and it required a lot of thinking/understanding since functions/data structures weren\u2019t defined until a lot later. [Redacted] is definitely a cool company to work for, but some form of structure in interviews would have been a lot more helpful. Spent a long time figuring out what the question is even asking, and interviewer was not language-agnostic.*\n\n> *I was expecting a more technical/design question that showcases the ability to think about a problem. Having a domain-specific question (regex) limits the ability to show one\u2019s problem-solving skills. I am sure with enough research one could come up with a beautiful regex expression but unless this is something one does often, I don\u2019t think it [makes for] a very good assessment.*\n\n> *This is not a good general interview question. A good interview question should have more than one solution with simplified constraints.*\n\n### Anatomy of a good technical interview question\n\n1. Layer complexity (including asking a warmup)\n2. No trivia\n3. Real-world components/relevance to the work the company is doing are preferable to textbook algorithmic problems\n4. If you\u2019re asking a classic algorithmic question, that\u2019s ok, but you ought to bring some nuance and depth to the table, and if you can teach the interviewee something interesting in the process, even better!\n\n## Asking the question\n\nOne of the other things we ask candidates after their interviews is how helpful their interviewer was in guiding them to the solution. Providing your candidate with well-timed hints that get them out of the weeds without giving away too much is a delicate art that takes a lot of practice (and a lot of repetition), but how much does it matter?\n\nAs it turns out, being able to do this well matters a ton. **Being good at providing hints was extremely significant** (p < 0.00001 with an effect size of 2.95) **when it came to whether the candidate wanted to move forward with the company (as before, we corrected for whether the interview went well)**.\n\nYou can see for yourself what candidates thought of their interviewers when it came to their helpfulness and engagement below. Though this attribute is a bit harder to quantify, it seems that hint quality is actually a specific instance of something bigger, namely the notion of turning something inherently adversarial into a collaborative exercise that leaves both people in a better place than where they started.[3](#user-content-fn-3)\n\nAnd if you can\u2019t do that every time, then at the very least, be present and engaged during the interview. And no matter what the devil on your shoulder tells you, no good will ever come of opening Reddit in another tab.[4](#user-content-fn-4)\n\nOne of the most memorable, pithy conversations I ever had about interviewing was with a seasoned engineer who had spent years as a very senior software architect at a huge tech company before going back to what he\u2019d always liked in the first place, writing code. He\u2019d conducted a lot of interviews over a career spanning several decades, and after trying out a number of different interview styles, what he settled on was elegant, simple, and satisfying. **According to him, the purpose of any interview is to \u201csee if we can be smart together.\u201d** I like that so much, and it\u2019s advice I repeat whenever anyone will listen.\n\n### The good\n\n> *I liked that you laid out the structure of the interview at the outset and mentioned that the first question did not have any tricks. That helped set the pace of the interview so I didn\u2019t spend an inordinate amount of time on the first one.*\n\n> *The interview wasn\u2019t easy, but it was really fun. It felt more like making a design discussion with a colleague than an interview. I think the question was designed/prepared to fill the 45 minute slot perfectly.*\n\n> *I\u2019m impressed by how quickly he identified the issue (typo) in my hash computation code and how gently he led me to locating it myself with two very high-level hints (\u201cwhat other tests cases would you try?\u201d and \u201cwould your code always work if you look for the the pattern that\u2019s just there at the beginning of the string?\u201d). Great job!*\n\n> *He never corrected me, instead asked questions and for me to elaborate in areas where I was incorrect \u2013 I very much appreciate this.*\n\n> *The question seemed very overwhelming at first but the interviewer was good at helping to break it down into smaller problems and suggest we focus on one of those first.*\n\n### The bad\n\n> *[It] was a little nerve-wracking hearing you yawn while I was coding.*\n\n> *What I found much more difficult about this interview was the lack of back and forth as I went along, even if it was simple affirmation that \u201cyes, that code you just wrote looks good\u201d. There were times when it seemed like I was the only one who had talked in the past five minutes (I\u2019m sure that\u2019s an exaggeration). This made it feel much more like a performance than like a collaboration, and my heart was racing at the end as a result.*\n\n> *While the question was very straightforward, and [he] was likely looking for me to blow through it with no prompting whatsoever in order to consider moving forward in an interview process, it would have been helpful to get a discussion or even mild hinting from him when I was obviously stuck thinking about an approach to solve the the problem. While I did get to the answer in the end, having a conversation about it would have made it feel more like a journey and learning experience. That would have also been a strong demonstration of the collaborative culture that exists while working with teams of people at a tech company, and would have sold me more vis-a-vis my excitement level.*\n\n> *If an interview is set to 45 minutes, the questions should fit this time frame, because people plan accordingly. I think that if you plan to have a longer interview you should notify the interviewee beforehand, so he can be ready for it.*\n\n> *One issue I had with the question though is what exactly he was trying to evaluate from me with the question. At points we talking about very nitty-gritty details about python linked list or array iteration, but it was unclear at any point if that was what he was judging me on. I think in the future he could outline at the beginning what exactly he was looking for with the problem in order to keep the conversation focused and ensure he is well calibrated judging candidates.*\n\n> *Try to be more familiar with all the possible solutions to the problem you choose to pose to the candidate. Try to work on communicating more clearly with the candidate.*\n\n### Anatomy of a good interview\n\n1. Set expectations, and control timing/pacing\n2. Be engaged!\n3. Familiarity with the problem and its associated rabbit holes/garden paths\n4. Good balance of hints and letting candidate think\n5. Turn the interview into a collaborative exercise where both people are free to be smart together\n\n## The art of storytelling\u2026 and the importance of being human\n\nBeyond choosing and crafting good questions and being engaged (but not overbearing) during the interview, what else do top-rated interviewers have in common?\n\nThe pervasive common thread I noticed among the best interviewers on our platform is, as above, a bit hard to quantify but dovetails well with the notion of being engaged and creating a collaborative experience. It\u2019s taking a dehumanizing process and elevating it to an organic experience between two capable, thinking humans. Many times, that translates into revealing something real about yourself and telling a story. It can be sharing a bit about the company you work at and why, out of all the places you could have landed, you ended up there. Or some aspect of the company\u2019s mission that resonated with you specifically. Or how the projects you\u2019ve worked on tie into your own, personal goals.\n\n### The good\n\n> *I like the interview format, in particular how it was primarily a discussion about cool tech, as well as an honest description of the company\u2026 the discussion section was valuable, and may be a better gauge of fit anyway. It\u2019s nice to see a company which places value on that \ud83d\ude42*\n\n> *The interviewer was helpful throughout the interview. He didn\u2019t mind any questions on their company\u2019s internal technology decisions, or how it\u2019s structured. I liked that the interviewer gave me a good insight of how the company functions.*\n\n> *Extremely kind and very generous with explaining everything they do at [redacted]. Really interested in the technical challenges they\u2019re working on. Great!*\n\n> *Interesting questions but the most valuable and interesting thing were the insights he gave me about [redacted]. He sounded very passionate about engineering in general, particularly about the challenges they are facing at [redacted]. Would love to work with him.*\n\n### The bad\n\n> *[A] little bit of friendly banter (even if it\u2019s just \u201chow are you doing\u201d?) at the very beginning of the interview would probably help a bit with keeping the candidate calm and comfortable.*\n\n> *I thought the interview was very impersonal, [and] I could not get a good read on the goal or mission of the company.*\n\nAnd, as we wrote about in a previous post, one of the most genuine, human things of all is [giving people immediate, actionable feedback](https://interviewing.io/blog/people-cant-gauge-their-own-interview-performance-and-that-makes-them-harder-to-hire). As you recall, during the feedback step that happens after each interview, we ask interviewees if they\u2019d want to work with their interviewer. As it turns out, there\u2019s a very statistically significant relationship (p < 0.00005) between whether people think they did well and whether they\u2019d want to work with the interviewer.[5](#user-content-fn-5) This means that when people think they did poorly, they may be a lot less likely to want to work with you. And by extension, it means that in every interview cycle, some portion of interviewees are losing interest in joining your company just because they didn\u2019t think they did well, despite the fact that they actually did.\n\nHow can one mitigate these losses? **Give positive, actionable feedback immediately (or as soon as possible)! This way people don\u2019t have time to go through the self-flagellation gauntlet that happens after a perceived poor performance, followed by the inevitable rationalization that they totally didn\u2019t want to work there anyway.**\n\n### How to be human\n\n1. Talk about what your company does\u2026 and what specifically about it appealed to you and made you want to join\n2. Talk about what you\u2019re currently working on and how that fits in with what you\u2019re passionate about\n3. When you like a candidate, give positive feedback as quickly as you can to save them from the self-flagellation that they\u2019ll likely go through otherwise\u2026 and which might make them rationalize away wanting to work with you\n4. And, you know, be friendly. A little bit of warmth can go a long way.\n\n## Becoming a better interviewer\n\nInterviewing people is hard. It\u2019s hard to come up with good [interview questions](https://interviewing.io/questions), it\u2019s hard to give a good interview, and it\u2019s especially hard to be human in the face of conducting a never-ending parade of interviews. But, being a good interviewer is massively important. As we saw, while your company\u2019s brand will get people in the door, once they\u2019ve reached the technical interview, the playing field is effectively level, and you can no longer use your brand as a crutch to mask poor questions or a lack of engagement. And in this market, where the best candidates have a ton of options, when wielded properly, a good interview that elevates a potentially cold, transactional interaction into something real and genuine can become the selling point that gets great engineers to work for you, whether you\u2019re a household name or a startup that just got its first users.\n\nGiven how important it is to do interviews well, what are some things you can do to get better right away? **One thing I found incredibly useful for coming up with good, original questions is to start a shared doc with your team where every time someone solves a problem they think is interesting, no matter how small, they jot down a quick note.** These notes don\u2019t have to be fleshed out at all, but they can be the seeds for unique interview questions that give candidates insight into the day-to-day at your company. Turning these disjointed seeds into interview questions takes thought and effort \u2014 you have to prune out a lot of the details and distill the essence of the problem into something it doesn\u2019t take the candidate a lot of work/setup to grok, and you\u2019ll likely have to iterate on the question a few times before you get it right \u2014 but they payoff can be huge.\n\nAnother thing you can do to get actionable feedback like the kind you saw in this post (and then immediately level up) is to get on interviewing.io as an interviewer. **If you interview people in our double-blind practice pool, no one will know who you are or which company you represent, which means that you get a truly unbiased take on your interviewing ability, which includes your question quality, how excited people would be to work with you, and how good you are at helping people along without giving away too much.** It\u2019s also a great way to go beyond your team, which can be pretty awkward, and try out new questions on a very engaged, high-quality user base. You\u2019ll also get to keep replays of your interviews so you can revisit crucial moments and figure out exactly what you need to do to get better next time.\n\n![Screenshot of the interviewer overall performance report](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffb028_screenshot_2017_11_29_11_52_16_528b62c8c9.png&w=1080&q=75 \"Overall performance\")\n\n*Want to hone your skills as an interviewer?

It\u2019s important to call out that brand and *engineering* brand are two separate things that can diverge pretty wildly. For instance, Target has a strong brand overall but probably not the best engineering brand (sorry). Heap, on the other hand, is one of the better-respected places to work among engineers (both on interviewing.io and off), but it doesn\u2019t have a huge overall brand. Both the Klout and Mattermark Mindshare scores aren\u2019t terrible for quantifying brand strength, but they\u2019re not amazing at engineering brand strength (they\u2019re high for Target and low for Heap). The Glassdoor score is a bit better because reviewers tend to skew engineering-heavy, but it\u2019s still not that great of a measure. So, if anyone has a better way to quantify this stuff, let me know. If I were doing it, I\u2019d probably look at GitHub repos of the company and its employees, who their investors are, and so on and so forth. But that\u2019s a project that\u2019s out of scope for this post. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-2)\n3. If you\u2019re familiar with [Dan Savage\u2019s campsite rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_Love#Campsite_rule) for relationships, I think there should be a similar for interviewing\u2026 leave your candidates in better shape than when you found them.

What\u2019s rude? What are the social norms? And so on.

And that makes them harder to hire.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: December 14, 2015; Last updated: May 25, 2023\n\n[interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/) is an anonymous technical interviewing platform. We started it because [resumes suck](https://blog.alinelerner.com/resumes-suck-heres-the-data/) and because we believe that anyone, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to prove their mettle. **In the past few months, we\u2019ve amassed over 600 technical interviews along with their associated data and metadata.** Interview questions tend to fall into the category of what you\u2019d encounter at a phone screen for a back-end software engineering role at a top company, and interviewers typically come from a mix of larger companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as engineering-focused startups like Asana, Mattermark, KeepSafe, and more.\n\nOver the course of the next few posts, we\u2019ll be sharing some { unexpected, horrifying, amusing, ultimately encouraging } things we\u2019ve learned. **In this blog\u2019s heroic maiden voyage, we\u2019ll be tackling people\u2019s surprising inability to gauge their own interview performance and the very real implications this finding has for hiring.**\n\n## First, a bit about setup\n\nWhen an interviewer and an interviewee match on our platform, they meet in a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard and jump right into a technical question. After each interview, people leave one another feedback, and each party can see what the other person said about them once they both submit their reviews. If both people find each other competent and pleasant, they have the option to unmask. **Overall, interviewees tend to do quite well on the platform, with just under half of interviews resulting in a \u201cyes\u201d from the interviewer.**\n\nIf you\u2019re curious, we have a few [public recordings](https://interviewing.io/mocks) of interviews done on the platform, so you can watch and see what an interview is really like. In addition to these, our feedback forms are attached below. There is one direct yes/no question, and we also ask about a few different aspects of interview performance using a 1-4 scale. We also ask interviewees some extra questions that we don\u2019t share with their interviewers, and one of those questions is about how well they think they did. **In this post, we\u2019ll be focusing on the technical score an interviewer gives an interviewee and the interviewee\u2019s self-assessment (both are circled below).** For context, a technical score of 3 or above seems to be the rough cut-off for hirability.\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F49613_interviewer_feedback_2025030f47.webp%3Fupdated_at%3D2022-12-14T11%3A48%3A18.080Z&w=1920&q=75 \"Feedback form for interviewers\")\n\nFeedback form for interviewers\n\n\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F8ddad_interviewee_feedback_fd66b6f2fd.webp%3Fupdated_at%3D2022-12-14T11%3A48%3A18.267Z&w=1920&q=75 \"Feedback form for interviewees\")\n\nFeedback form for interviewees\n\n## Perceived versus actual performance\n\nBelow, you can see the distribution of people\u2019s actual technical performance (as rated by their interviewers) and the distribution of their perceived performance (how they rated themselves) for the same set of interviews.[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n\nYou might notice right away that there is a little bit of disparity, but things get interesting when you plot perceived vs. actual performance *for each interview*. Below, is a heatmap of the data where the darker areas represent higher interview concentration. For instance, the darkest square represents interviews where both perceived and actual performance was rated as a 3. You can hover over each square to see the exact interview count (denoted by \u201cz\u201d).\n\nIf you run a regression on this data[2](#user-content-fn-2), you get an R-squared of only 0.24, and once you take away the worst interviews, it drops down even further to a 0.16. For context, [R-squared](https://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics/regression-analysis-how-do-i-interpret-r-squared-and-assess-the-goodness-of-fit) is a measurement of how well you can fit empirical data to some mathematical model. It\u2019s on a scale from 0 to 1 with 0 meaning that everything is noise and 1 meaning that everything fits perfectly. **In other words, even though some small positive relationship between actual and perceived performance does exist, it is not a strong, predictable correspondence.**\n\nYou can also see there\u2019s a non-trivial amount of impostor syndrome going on in the graph above, which probably comes as no surprise to anyone who\u2019s been an engineer.\n\nGayle Laakmann McDowell of *Cracking the Coding Interview* fame has written quite a bit about [how bad people are at gauging their own interview performance](https://www.gayle.com/blog/2011/03/31/why-your-interview-performance-is-impossible-to-judge), and it\u2019s something that I had noticed anecdotally when I was doing recruiting, so it was nice to see some empirical data on that front. In her writing, Gayle mentions that it\u2019s the job of a good interviewer to make you feel like you did OK even if you bombed. I was curious about whether that\u2019s what was going on here, but when I ran the numbers, there wasn\u2019t any relationship between how highly an interviewer was rated overall and how off their interviewees\u2019 self-assessments were, in one direction or the other.\n\nUltimately, this isn\u2019t a big data set, and we will continue to monitor the relationship between perceived and actual performance as we host more interviews, but we did find that this relationship emerged very early on and has continued to persist with more and more interviews \u2014 R-squared has never exceeded 0.26 to date.\n\n## Why this matters for hiring\n\nNow here\u2019s the actionable and kind of messed up part. As you recall, during the feedback step that happens after each interview, we ask interviewees if they\u2019d want to work with their interviewer. **As it turns out, there\u2019s a very statistically significant relationship** (*[p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value)* < 0.0008) **between whether people think they did well and whether they\u2019d want to work with the interviewer. This means that when people think they did poorly, they may be a lot less likely to want to work with you**[3](#user-content-fn-3). And by extension, it means that in every interview cycle, some portion of interviewees are losing interest in joining your company just because they didn\u2019t think they did well, *despite the fact that they actually did*.\n\n**How can one mitigate these losses? Give positive, actionable feedback immediately (or as soon as possible)!** This way people don\u2019t have time to go through the self-flagellation gauntlet that happens after a perceived poor performance, followed by the inevitable rationalization that they *totally* didn\u2019t want to work there anyway.\n\n*Lastly, a quick shout-out to [Statwing](https://www.statwing.com) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) for making terrific data analysis and graphing tools respectively.*\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. There are only 254 interviews represented here because not all interviews in our data set had comprehensive, mutual feedback. Moreover, we realize that raw scores don\u2019t tell the whole story and will be focusing on standardization of these scores and the resulting rat\u2019s nest in our next post. That said, though interviewer strictness does vary, we gate interviewers pretty heavily based on their background and experience, so the overall bar is high and comparable to what you\u2019d find at a good company in the wild. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n2. Here we are referring to linear regression, and though we tried fitting a number of different curves to the data, they all sucked. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-2)\n3. In our data, people were 3 times less likely to want to work with their interviewers when they thought they did poorly.

It was my attempt to understand what attributes of someone\u2019s resume actually mattered for getting a software engineering job. Surprisingly, as it turned out, where someone went to school didn\u2019t matter at all, and by far and away, the strongest signal came from the number of typos and grammatical errors on their resume.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve discovered (and written about) how [useless resumes are](https://blog.alinelerner.com/resumes-suck-heres-the-data/), but ever since writing that first post, I\u2019ve been itching to do something similar with interviewing.io\u2019s data. For context, interviewing.io is a platform where people can practice technical interviewing anonymously and, in the process, find jobs \u2014 do well in practice, and you get guaranteed (and anonymous!) technical interviews at companies like Uber, Twitch, Lyft, and more. Over the course of our existence, we\u2019ve amassed performance data from thousands of real and practice interviews. **Data from these interviews sets us up nicely to look at what signals from an interviewee\u2019s background might matter when it comes to performance.**\n\nAs often happens, what we found was surprising, and some of it runs counter to things I\u2019ve said and written on the subject. More on that in a bit.\n\n## The setup\n\nWhen an interviewer and an interviewee match on our platform, they meet in a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard and jump right into a technical question (check out our [recordings](https://interviewing.io/mocks) page to see this in action). Interview questions on the platform tend to fall into the category of what you\u2019d encounter at a phone screen for a back-end software engineering role, and interviewers typically come from a mix of large companies like Google, Facebook, and Uber, as well as engineering-focused startups like Asana, Mattermark, KeepSafe, and more.\n\nAfter every interview, interviewers rate interviewees on a few different dimensions, including technical ability. Technical ability gets rated on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 is \u201cpoor\u201d and 4 is \u201camazing!\u201d. On our platform, a score of 3 or above has generally meant that the person was good enough to move forward. You can see what our feedback form looks like below:\n\n![Screenshot of the interview feedback form](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffeedback_circled_40095dd6e4.png&w=1200&q=75 \"Example feedback form\")\n\n**To run the analysis for this post, we cross-referenced interviewees\u2019 average technical scores** (circled in red in the feedback form above) **with the attributes below to see which ones mattered most**.[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n\n- Attended a top computer science school\n- Worked at a top company\n- Took classes on Udacity/Coursera[2](#user-content-fn-2)\n- Founded a startup\n- Master\u2019s degree\n- Years of experience\n\n**Of all of these, only 3 attributes emerged as statistically significant: top school, top company, and classes on Udacity/Coursera.** Apparently, as the fine gentlemen of Metallica once said, nothing else matters. In the graph below, you can see the [effect size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size) of each of the significant attributes (attributes that didn\u2019t achieve significance don\u2019t have bars).\n\nAs I said at the outset, these results were quite surprising, and I\u2019ll take a stab at explaining each of the outcomes below.\n\n## Top school & top company\n\nGoing into this, I expected top company to matter but not top school. The company thing makes sense \u2014 you\u2019re selecting people who\u2019ve successfully been through at least one interview gauntlet, so the odds of them succeeding at future ones should be higher.\n\nTop school is a bit more muddy, and it was indeed the least impactful of the significant attributes. Why did schooling matter in this iteration of the data but didn\u2019t matter when I was looking at resumes? I expect the answer lies in the disparity between performance in an isolated technical phone screen versus what happens when a candidate actually goes on site. With the right preparation, the technical phone interview is manageable, and top schools often have rigorous algorithms classes and a culture of preparing for technical phone screens (to see why this culture matters and how it might create an unfair advantage for those immersed in it, see my post about how we need to [rethink the technical interview](https://interviewing.io/blog/you-cant-fix-diversity-in-tech-without-fixing-the-technical-interview)). Whether passing an algorithmic technical phone screen means you\u2019re a great engineer is another matter entirely and hopefully the subject of a future post.\n\n## Udacity/Coursera\n\nMOOC participation (Udacity and Coursera in particular, as those were the ones interviewing.io users gravitated to most) mattering as much as it did (and mattering way more than pedigree) was probably the most surprising finding here, and so it merited some additional digging.\n\nIn particular, I was curious about the interplay between MOOCs and top schools, so I partitioned MOOC participants into people who had attended top schools vs. people who hadn\u2019t. When I did that, something startling emerged. **For people who attended top schools, completing Udacity or Coursera courses didn\u2019t appear to matter. However, for people who did not, the effect was huge, so huge, in fact, that it dominated the board.** Moreover, interviewees who attended top schools performed significantly worse than interviewees who had not attended top schools but HAD taken a Udacity or Coursera course.\n\nSo, what does this mean? Of course (as you\u2019re probably thinking to yourself while you read this), correlation doesn\u2019t imply causation. As such, rather than MOOCs being a magic pill, I expect that people who gravitate toward online courses (and especially those who might have a chip on their shoulder about their undergrad pedigree and end up drinking from the MOOC firehose) already tend to be abnormally driven. But, even with that, I\u2019d be hard pressed to say that completing great online CS classes isn\u2019t going to help you become a better interviewee, especially if you didn\u2019t have the benefit of a rigorous algorithms class up until then. Indeed, a lot of the courses we saw people take focused around algorithms, so it\u2019s no surprise that supplementing your preparation with courses like this could be tremendously useful. Some of the most popular courses we saw were:\n\n**Udacity**\n\n- [Design of Computer Programs](https://www.udacity.com/course/design-of-computer-programs--cs212)\n- [Intro to Algorithms](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-algorithms--cs215)\n- [Computability, Complexity & Algorithms](https://www.udacity.com/course/computability-complexity-algorithms--ud061)\n\n**Coursera**\n\n- [Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)\n- [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1)\n- [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)\n- [Algorithms on Graphs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs)\n\n## Founder status\n\nHaving been a founder didn\u2019t matter at all when it came to technical interview performance. This, too, isn\u2019t that surprising. The things that make one a good founder are not necessarily the things that make one a good engineer, and if you just came out of running a startup and are looking to get back into an individual contributor role, odds are, your interview skills will be a bit rusty. This is, of course, true of folks who\u2019ve been in industry but out of interviewing for some time, as you\u2019ll see below.\n\n## Master\u2019s degree & years of experience\n\nNo surprises here. I\u2019ve ranted quite a bit about the [disutility of master\u2019s degrees](https://blog.alinelerner.com/how-different-is-a-b-s-in-computer-science-from-a-m-s-in-computer-science-when-it-comes-to-recruiting/), so I won\u2019t belabor the point.\n\nYears of experience, too, shouldn\u2019t be that surprising. For context, our average user has about 5 years of experience, with most having between 2 and 10. I think we\u2019ve all anecdotally observed that the time spent away from your schooling doesn\u2019t do you any favors when it comes to interview prep. You can see a scatter plot of interview performance vs. years of experience below as well as my attempt to fit a line through it (as you can see, the R^2 is piss poor, meaning that there isn\u2019t a relationship to speak of).\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nIf you know me, or even if you\u2019ve read some of my writing, you know that, in the past, I\u2019ve been quite loudly opposed to the concept of pedigree as a useful hiring signal. With that in mind, I feel like I owe clearly acknowledge, up front, that we found this time runs counter to my stance. But that\u2019s the whole point, isn\u2019t it? You live, you get some data, you make some graphs, you learn, you make new graphs, and you adjust. **Even with this new data, I\u2019m excited to see that what mattered way more than pedigree was the actions people took to better themselves (in this case, rounding out their existing knowledge with MOOCs), regardless of their background.**\n\nMost importantly, these findings have done nothing to change interviewing.io\u2019s core mission. We\u2019re creating an efficient and meritocratic way for candidates and companies to find each other, and as long as you can code, we couldn\u2019t care less about who you are or where you come from. In our ideal world, all these conversations about which proxies matter more than others would be moot non-starters because coding ability would stand for, well, coding ability. And that\u2019s the world we\u2019re building.\n\n*Thanks to Roman Rivilis for his help with data annotation for this post.*\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. For fun, we tried relating browser and operating system choice to interview performance, (smugly) expecting Chrome users to dominate. Not so. Browser choice didn\u2019t matter, nor did what OS people used while interviewing. We got this data from looking at interviewees\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n2.

I\u2019ll spare you the long version (you can find that in our [announcement that we\u2019re out of beta](https://interviewing.io/blog/interviewing-io-is-out-of-beta-anonymous-technical-interview-practice-for-all), as well as our [Series A announcement](https://interviewing.io/blog/weve-raised-our-series-a), but the TL;DR is that we used to make money from employers, and mock interviews were free for engineers. Then hiring basically froze when COVID-19 happened, and to survive, we started charging engineers. We didn\u2019t feel great about it, but the company would have shut down otherwise. The silver lining was that this allowed us to open up interviewing.io to engineers of all experience levels and in more locations and also meant that we no longer needed to throttle how many mock interviews people could do.\n\nWhen I announced that we were starting to charge our users, I promised 2 things: (1) We would start a Fellowship program for engineers from non-traditional backgrounds, where they could receive mentorship and practice for free, and (2) We would create a program where you didn\u2019t have to pay for practice till you got a job.\n\nWe launched our [Technical Interview Practice Fellowship](https://interviewing.io/blog/announcing-the-interviewing-io-technical-interview-practice-fellowship) in 2020 and have completed 2 successful cohorts so far. We also launched our beta deferred payment program in September 2020 and ran it for a year to see what portion of users would get jobs and pay us back. When that was successful, we followed it in January 2021 with a much bigger, fully productized version called the Pay Later Program.\n\nUnfortunately, we recently made the very difficult decision to pause our Pay Later Program. In this post, we\u2019ll talk about why we made that call and what we\u2019ll be doing instead to ensure that engineers who can\u2019t afford to pay for practice will still be able to get it. We\u2019ll also explain some things we\u2019ve learned along the way about funnel optimization, some mistakes we made while iterating on this program, and what we\u2019ll do differently when we hopefully unpause it in the future.\n\nBut first, some history.\n\n## Our beta deferral program\n\nEver since we started charging, we wanted to give users a way to de-risk buying interview practice. **However, we didn\u2019t want to subject our users to lengthy and invasive loan applications.** I had seen what some Income Share Agreement (ISA) application processes looked like, and they turned my stomach \u2013 many demanded bank account info so they could periodically check on your purchases. In one demo we saw, one of these firms bragged that if a student was spending too much money at Starbucks, it could be a sign that it was time to collect.\n\nWe didn\u2019t want any part of that. We also wanted to distance ourselves from ISAs in general \u2013 mock interviews don\u2019t cost tens of thousands of dollars, so with us, you wouldn\u2019t have to give us a portion of your income. You\u2019d just defer paying us for some number of mock interviews, which would usually run you somewhere between $500-$1000 depending on the number of interviews. So, we decided we\u2019d ideally backstop this program ourselves, and as a precursor, we ran the beta deferral program for a year to see what kinds of payback rates we\u2019d get.\n\nBelow are the terms of the original deferral program. While this program was in beta, most of our enrollment flow was in Typeform. It looked like this:\n\n![Deferral program application - page 1 - about the program](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdeferral_program_application_page_1_a107f6db8f.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Deferral program application - page 1\")\n\nThen we\u2019d ask a few questions, and the final step of the form was to sign a contract, like so:\n\n![Deferral program application - page 2 - agreement terms](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdeferral_program_application_page_2_2222461614.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Deferral program application - page 2\")\n\n**After 4 months, we saw a 70% payback rate, and after 6 months, it was around 90%.** Between September 2020 and September 2021, over 500 beta users enrolled in this program, and feedback was overwhelmingly positive.\n\nWe felt great about this; however, we knew that the execution of the beta was still clunky. Typeform was our whole UI, and our back-end included a bunch of manual work held together with chewing gum and a massive spreadsheet, where we tracked enrollments, statuses, and paybacks.\n\nWhen we saw that the deferral program was clearly working, we decided to go all in, remove the manual work, and productize it properly.\n\n## The shiny new Pay Later Program\n\nThe new Pay Later Program would be a fully automated, shiny version of what we had cobbled together in the beta. The terms would be streamlined, enrollment would be easier, check-in emails would be automatic, and everything would just\u2026 *work.* As such, we took a critical look at the deferral program flow and all of the operational pain points and decided to streamline them as much as possible.\n\nBecause so many people in the old deferral program reached out asking to upgrade their algorithmic interviews to something more specialized (e.g., \u201cI want to practice machine learning instead,\u201d \u201cI want an interviewer specifically from Google/Amazon/Facebook\u201d), we decided to make the next version easier for everyone by just giving users interviewing.io credits.\n\nWhen you enrolled in the program, you\u2019d start with $512 or $1024 in credits (your choice) that you could spend on any mock interview or mentorship session that you liked.\n\n**We launched our Pay Later Program at the end of December 2021. As we usually do with new features, we A/B tested a few different variants, with the intent of increasing enrollment as much as possible each time.**\n\nOur first iteration of Pay Later was almost identical to its predecessor, the deferral program, except that instead of having to fill out a Typeform, the enrollment flow was in our app. Here\u2019s how it looked:\n\n![Screenshot of the Deferral Program enrollment form - personal details and credit amount](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FScreen_Shot_2022_09_28_at_5_41_04_PM_efb0b88942.png&w=828&q=75 \"Deferral Program enrollment form - personal details and credit amount\")\n\nThe only out-of-app part of the experience was having to sign a contract in HelloSign. We also had a very wordy explanation of the terms. It was a wall of text, much like the first page of the old Typeform.\n\n**Over time, as we continued to A/B test, we pruned more and more steps, tried different UIs, and even changed up the terms. We were ultimately able to more than *double* enrollment in the Pay Later Program.** The 3 biggest and most impactful changes we made were:\n\n- Removing the contract-signing step entirely. Instead, we just asked users to check a box that said, \u201cI agree to the terms of the Pay Later Program,\u201d where clicking into the terms opened them in a new tab (see the screenshot below). *This was by far the most impactful change.*\n- Making our terms more lax. Instead of charging you 4 months later, if you stayed at your job, we amended the terms to make it so you could get as many extensions as you needed, as long as you were still looking for a job (in good faith).\n- Condensing the terms summary from the wordy bullets in the original Typeform to the blue box below:\n\n![Screenshot of the Deferral Program enrollment form - provide a valid credit card](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fpay_later_program_page_1_55f906a475.png&w=1200&q=75 \"Deferral Program enrollment form - provide a valid credit card\")\n\n## The dangers of funnel hacking\n\nOur new Pay Later Program was objectively better for users than our old deferral program for 2 reasons. First, it was more flexible \u2013 users got credits they could spend however they wished, instead of 5 algorithmic interviews that they\u2019d have to pay to upgrade. Second, the terms were more generous and user-friendly \u2013 you didn\u2019t have to pay us back if you stayed at your old job, as long as you promised us you were still looking, whereas in the old deferral program if you stayed at your current job, you\u2019d have to pay back the full amount after 4 months.\n\n**Despite the offering being objectively better, user feedback was objectively worse.**\n\nIn our quest to increase funnel throughput, we made enrollment too frictionless. **By no longer requiring people to sign a contract and by basically creating 2-click enrollment with an abbreviated TL;DR that glossed over the mechanics of payback** (we\u2019ll send you an email, we\u2019ll charge if we don\u2019t hear back from you, you\u2019re on the hook for the full amount and any unused credits are yours to keep in perpetuity), **we failed to sufficiently explain the program to users, many of whom were justifiably shocked when they got billed.**\n\nReading a contract and signing it forced users to think through whether they were willing to be on the hook for a non-trivial amount of money. When we made enrollment as easy as clicking a few buttons, many users (understandably) no longer read the terms and made assumptions about how the program worked. These assumptions varied from \u201cI thought these interviews were free\u201d to \u201cI thought I only had to pay if I got a job specifically at Google\u201d to \u201cI never signed up for this.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, of course it made sense that some portion of our users were irate and called us a scam when we emailed to ask if they were ready to pay us back. What sucked is that, even though we created this program with the best of intentions and modified the terms to make them more permissive, because of how we packaged and presented it, we experienced a very different response than from the original deferral program.\n\nThough the majority of users still paid us back within the 4 month period, there was now an angry and disappointed vocal minority, and our ops team began to dread the end of the month, when we\u2019d invariably receive a number of irate emails stating that interviewing.io was a scam.\n\n**I don\u2019t feel great that I got caught up in the funnel hacking and in seeing enrollment numbers increase.** If you\u2019ve read my writing over the years, you\u2019ll know that I take pride in transparency, candor, and clarity. You may also know that our one core value as a company is putting our users (i.e., engineers practicing for interviews) first. I didn\u2019t live up to that this time, and I am sorry.\n\n**Practically speaking, I\u2019ve learned that creating some amount of friction is necessary when you\u2019re asking people to promise to pay you ~$1000 in the future. Removing that friction can create short-term wins but may hurt you (and disappoint your users) in the long run.**\n\nNow, you might expect that if we just revert the flow and bring back the friction, everything will be great again. Unfortunately not.\n\n## Why we\u2019re pausing\n\nIn the current economic climate, we\u2019ve had to take a hard look at our business and, like many other companies, cut our burn and tighten our belts. When we launched the program and committed to backstopping it ourselves, it was with the expectation that hiring would continue at a healthy clip. We anticipated a hiring slowdown in the recession, but multiple FAANGs freezing hiring was beyond what we had predicted \u2013 all of our models and assumptions had been based on COVID-era economics. This was something new.\n\nThe reality is that because the payback period is at least 4 months, regardless, as long as we\u2019re running it, we are losing 4 months of runway. In this climate that\u2019s significant.\n\nDespite that, we knew that for some portion of our users, the existence of this program would be the difference between being able to practice and not, so we looked into financing it through a third party. Here\u2019s how we did the math:\n\n1. Estimate our enrollment rate in the Pay Later Program if we go back to the old UI/UX and terms.\n2. Estimate our payback rate for the Pay Later Program moving forward\n3. Cross-reference (1) and (2) with the interest rates we\u2019d be paying to finance the program\n\n**Unfortunately, no matter how we ran the numbers, we couldn\u2019t find a way to make this program ROI positive in the near term, especially with the reduction in enrollment we\u2019d expect upon adding friction back into our enrollment process**, which we decided would be a hard requirement for bringing back the program \u2013 we learned to be careful with growth hacks through the mistakes we made with this program, and we will not repeat them.\n\nIn summary, the old flow had a lot of friction, and in the current climate, enrollment rates would be too low to justify its existence. The new flow had significantly more enrollment, but it made it too easy for users to enroll without grokking the terms, and this generated enough negative feedback from users to make us want to kill it, especially given our company\u2019s core value of putting our engineering community first. Finally, even if we kept tweaking the old flow to find the perfect balance, payback rates within a reasonable time window would be too low to be ROI positive when we factor in the cost of financing this program by a 3rd party, which we\u2019d need to do to conserve cash.\n\nIt\u2019s possible we\u2019ll bring this program back in the future, but if we do, it\u2019ll look substantially different from what we released in 2022.\n\n## What about users who are already enrolled in the Pay Later Program?\n\nIf you\u2019re already enrolled, you\u2019re good! Your credits will continue to work in perpetuity, just like we promised, and we\u2019ll honor the terms: You get extensions as long as you haven\u2019t found a job and are still actively looking.\n\n## What we\u2019re doing instead to help those who can\u2019t afford to pay for practice\n\nWe realize that many of you were depending on this program to be able to practice, especially during a recession. Even though we\u2019ve paused our Pay Later Program, until we hopefully bring it back in the future, we have a few other ways that we can make it easier for you to get the practice you need.\n\n- We still have peer-to-peer practice interviews, where you get matched with other interviewing.io users and work problems together. We introduced these right after COVID-19, and they\u2019re not going anywhere. You get 1 interview with a peer when you join the platform, and after that, you can unlock more by conducting interviews yourself. We\u2019ll be looking at this program to see how we can make it more accessible.\n- We\u2019ll be starting the next cohort of our Fellowship for engineers from non-traditional backgrounds soon.\n- We\u2019re experimenting with a few other ideas that may, together, fill the void created by the Pay Later Program. One of the more promising items is implementing Affirm, which will let our users defer payment for practice or pay it in smaller chunks.\n\nThis was a hard post to write, and I welcome feedback.

Time for another awesome guest post.*\n\n*We\u2019ve written before [about what the data says makes a good interviewer](https://interviewing.io/blog/best-technical-interviews-common) and about how [companies do a poor job of incentivizing engineers to be good interviewers](https://interviewing.io/blog/we-have-the-best-technical-interviewers-heres-how-we-do-it). But we\u2019ve never really described what it feels like to interact with a great interviewer and how being one matters now, more than ever, given how well-prepared candidates have become and how much harder it is to get signal from them as a result.\n\nWhich is why I\u2019m so excited about this guest post from Jos Visser. Enjoy!*\n\n*Btw, if you have strong opinions about interviewing or hiring that you\u2019ve been itching to write about, we\u2019d love to hear from you.

He has over 500 interviews under his belt at companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and OpenAI.

Jos can be reached at [josvisser66@gmail.com](mailto:josvisser66@gmail.com) or through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josvisser1/).\n\nIt is high time we start talking about interviewing. I know it seems like we are talking about interviewing all the time, but we are usually talking about only one half of the equation: How to be a good candidate. What about [the other half](https://marillionofficial.bandcamp.com/track/the-other-half)? What about the interviewer?\n\nIn the last decade, there has been an explosion of attention for candidates and how to improve their interview performance. There are blogs, [sites](https://interviewing.io/), [companies](https://interviewing.io/), and [books](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) that help you improve your interviewing skills. You can sharpen your coding skills, learn how to approach a [system design interview](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.CZwZ7txhICEtME2JuLCqj9fgDsTqCNi6KP7xke4eHp__iSdKSNwJz56sicfx_gWfRM7WlOrimmrvhV3DbzxY-0yUKmZGzld1ApW5-nESf1MKb1R_X9QteAFNuLJICcdWXjZKH8r4AH_0iEBs23dbBT4rpp3Nq87gQuIohh2HraAtqEvgw34HTXdR1ZnKnRR4-d9ZIA3m3wxWE2K8j4ZgubgB5dXZ3_0KjYWyti-kwcw.ysz-FWrN1DJdhG6ecHx7ipt7R1Cl3dOEnxwKurNtL18&dib_tag=se&keywords=alex+yu+system+design&qid=1717331123&sr=8-1), read entire volumes of [standard answers to standard questions](https://www.themuse.com/advice/interview-questions-and-answers), do [mock interviews](https://interviewing.io/), and learn how to use the [STAR method](https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method) to answer behavioral questions. These days, candidates are often very well prepared for a standard interview and therefore, bar a brain fart, do well at that.\n\nThis stands in stark contrast to the preparation of the *interviewer*. If you are lucky, your interviewer might have gotten a two hour class on how to ask only bona fide work related questions and has sat through two shadow interviews. Maybe they have even done a few interviews! Consequently, there is a lot of bad interviewing being done. That needs to change.\n\nLet\u2019s start by acknowledging that interviewing is very hard. The average interview is a 45 minute video conference in which you need to get the audio and video hardware working, engage in introductory chit chat, give the candidate some time to ask you any questions , and ascertain whether they got what it takes to be successful in the role. Given all the overhead involved, you *might* only get 35 minutes for the meat of the interview. This is not a lot of time, especially if the candidate is, as I indicated above, often very well prepared.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it is *good* that candidates are prepared. It shows an interest in doing well and displays the kind of methodical approach to reach a goal that I *want* to see in the candidate. But it *does* make interviewing a lot harder.\n\nIn the olden days, you could surprise a candidate by asking how to [remove a file called -f](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/josvisser1_a-standard-linux-interview-question-is-how-activity-7199771506543841281-1Rrj?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) or [how to sort one million eight-digit numbers with only 1MB of RAM](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12748246/sorting-1-million-8-decimal-digit-numbers-with-1-mb-of-ram/13004000#13004000). It would unfailingly be the first time the candidate ever saw that question and so you were immediately seeing how the candidate dealt with solving a problem that they had never solved before and probably never even thought about. This often prompted interesting discussions and you could see the candidate\u2019s brain at work in solving a novel problem.\n\nWe live in different times now. A lot of candidates have seen all the common questions and are exquisitely prepared for them. As a result, whenever they give the right answer, you have learned nothing about the candidate, other than that they were probably well prepared for this particular question. Take the [min-stack question](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/description/). I used to like this question because it is not entirely trivial and has some half-way interesting trade offs between time and space complexity. Then some genius came up with a non-trivial solution that [solves](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-stack-that-supports-getmin-in-o1-time-and-o1-extra-space/#) the question in O(1) time and O(1) space. It is a super cool trick and I would not expect *anyone* to come up with it from scratch in 35 minutes. If you ask the question today and people immediately knock out the optimal solution, you *know* that they memorized the answer and you have learnt nothing. Same for how to design a [URL shortener](https://systemdesignschool.io/problems/url-shortener/solution) or a [key/value store](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-modern-system-design-interview-for-engineers-managers/system-design-the-key-value-store).\n\nThis experience might give rise to the idea that all the current questions are known and that we just need a collection of new questions. That idea is wrong; it is not about the questions. Exaggerating a bit, I am of the opinion that all interview questions that can be asked within the scope of a 45-minute interview are known already. Coming up with a \u201cnew\u201d question typically just means replacing the gift wrapping around the core algorithm of an old question with new gift wrapping, thereby making it look new. Even if, through a stroke of genius, you manage to come up with a brand new unique never-before-seen question, there is no way to keep it secret. As soon as you give it to a candidate, the question is out and the entire candidate prepping industry will cover it on their sites and blogs, and in their mock interviews and books. It\u2019s like keeping the new Taylor Swift album secret, [it ain\u2019t gonna happen](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2024/04/19/taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-album-leak/).\n\nSo interviewing is hard to begin with and even harder with well-prepared candidates. How to deal with that?\n\nThe non-answer to this question in my opinion is to replace (some) interviews with take-home assignments. [I wrote about this before](https://josvisser.substack.com/p/interviewing-has-become-a-mess) and by and large I consider it a mistake. Not only does it put the burden of getting a better signal solely on the candidates, it also is a method to ensure that great candidates, with lots of places to go, do not bother to enter your interviewing process. It\u2019s just another example of penny wise and pound foolish. I am not saying it cannot be done right, but what I have seen so far does not inspire me with confidence.\n\nInstead, my answer is to match like with like: If the candidates are becoming better at being candidates, the interviewers need to become better at being interviewers.\n\nOne of the ways in which a lot of interviewers need to become better is through getting rid of the idea that good interviewing starts and ends with good questions. Nothing could be further from the truth. Surely, a good question is always better than a bad question, but a *good* interviewer can still get lots of signal from handling a bad question well, whereas a *bad* interviewer cannot get any signal from a great question. It really is not about the question, and that is one of the things I think good interviewer training needs to cover.\n\nBut if good interviewing is not about the question, then what is it about? The answer is: **Digging**.\n\nLet\u2019s take the world famous \u201chow to remove a file called -f\u201d interview question. There is a canonical answer, which is to use rm -- -f. If the candidate knows this, that\u2019s okay, but not more than that, because you haven\u2019t learned anything about the candidate\u2019s knowledge and thinking yet (other than they know this \u201ctrick\u201d). When I get this answer, I would be wondering whether the candidate *understands* why this works. Do they understand if rm -f? Or rm '-f'? Or rm ./-f? And what about X=-f rm $X? And if so, or if not, why, or why not? And why exactly does a plain \u201crm -f\u201d not work? Would rm -\\* work? And does it matter what Unix system you are on? Or which shell you are using? And does python -c \"import os; os.unlink('-f')\" work? And if so why? And if rm -- -f works, does that automatically mean that touch -- -f works to create that file?\n\nYou can use this very simple question as a starting point for an extensive discussion about shell argument expansion, command line parsing by Unix binaries, the getopt(3) library function, the unlink(2) system call, and the many interesting ways in which the GNU, BSD, and System V versions of common utilities differ in this respect. While you are at it, you might as well throw in follow up questions about $IFS, spaces in file names, hidden files, inode numbers, device files, hard links and symbolic links If -f is a symbolic link, does rm -- -f remove the link or the file linked to? And what if -f was a hard link?\n\nInterviewing is about *digging*, about never taking the candidate\u2019s answer at face value, and about taking the answer and using it as a jumping board to ask follow-up questions. I really don\u2019t care if the candidate knows the answer to my questions up-front. What I care about is whether they can reason towards the answer using the knowledge they have and the additional knowledge I might give them in the course of the interview. If the candidate comes in knowing next to nothing about the Unix shell, but they can deduce what is going on from the examples I give them and propose experiments to test the hypotheses they come up with, I am as [happy as a clam at high tide](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/happy+as+a+clam+at+high+tide).\n\nInterviewers can learn how to dig. They can learn how to write better feedback. They can learn how to evaluate a candidate correctly against the hiring bar. It might not be easy, but it is not not rocket science either. That said, learning how to interview well is real work; real work that you can *only* expect from people who are *interested* in being great interviewers and who are duly recognized.\n\nIt is probably a dirty secret that in many companies, a lot of engineers are seeing interviewing as a chore to be dispensed with quickly and with as little effort as possible: They often get little to no training, there is no quality control, no feedback on feedback, and there are no incentives to be great or to get better. No wonder that a lot of interviews are suboptimal.\n\nFortunately, in most companies, you don\u2019t need all engineers to be interviewers, so you can restrict yourself to the ones who *want* to interview. You can then create a culture of interviewing; a culture where great interviewing is the norm, and where that great interviewing is rewarded.\n\nRewards are essential here. To quote [Charlie Munger](https://fs.blog/great-talks/psychology-human-misjudgment/): \u201cShow me the incentives, and I\u2019ll show you the outcome.\u201d It doesn\u2019t have to be money. Or at least, not a lot of money, as rewards come in many forms: Public recognition, swag, a \u201cGreat Interviewer\u201d mug, a badge on the internal phone book pages, or a shout out at the all-hands. All of these conspire to give people the idea that they are doing important and meaningful work. Plus it gives the managers of the interviewers the idea that they are enabling an essential company function. And of course: Great interviewing needs to help you get promoted. If it doesn\u2019t, then you might as well go write another design document rather than spending your time on attending your local interviewing club.\n\nThere is unfortunately no cheap and easy way for your interviewers to become better. It is not hard to improve interviewing quality and effectiveness, but it does require time, money, and effort. Plus it helps if you know what you are doing (as a company hiring engineers).\n\nLife is chaos and pain. Interview prep doesn't have to be.\n\n![Video Preview](/static/images/cyber-corgi/artboard.svg)\n\nGet instant access to anonymous mock interviews, salary negotiation, and the world's largest library of interview replays.\n\n[Get started](/signup)\n\n#### Related posts\n\n[No engineer has ever sued a company because of constructive post-interview feedback.

And you can too.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: January 17, 2023; Last updated: May 1, 2023\n\ninterviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform and eng hiring marketplace. Engineers use us for mock interviews, and we use the data from those interviews to surface top performers, in a much fairer and more predictive way than a resume. If you\u2019re a top performer on interviewing.io, we fast-track you at the world\u2019s best companies.\n\nWe make money in two ways: engineers pay us for mock interviews, and employers pay us for access to the best performers. Companies connect with our engineers through anonymous technical interviews \u2014 this is really important to us because we don\u2019t want employers to be biased by where people went to school or where they previously worked. When employers use interviewing.io, they get great candidates, on the condition that they\u2019re willing to talk to them anonymously. And it really is anonymous \u2013 they get zero information about the candidates ahead of time, and they agree to devote precious engineering time to interviewing people who are, from their perspective, basically randos off the internet.\n\nTo keep our engineer customers happy, we have to make sure that our interviewers deliver value to them by conducting realistic mock interviews and giving useful, actionable feedback afterwards.\n\nTo keep our employer customers happy, we have to make sure that the engineers we send them are way better than the ones they\u2019re getting without us[1](#user-content-fn-1). Otherwise, it\u2019s just not worth it for them.\n\n**This means that we live and die by the quality of our interviewers, in a way that no single employer does, no matter how much they say they care about people analytics or interviewer metrics or training. If we don\u2019t have really well-calibrated interviewers, who also create great candidate experience, we don\u2019t get paid.**\n\nFortunately, we have two pieces of data that no single employer can collect: 1) honest candidate feedback and 2) real outcomes for candidates, from multiple interviews at multiple companies.\n\nThe former helps us figure out how effective our interviewers are at engaging candidates and creating great candidate experience. The latter helps us figure out how well-calibrated our interviewers are, with a high degree of confidence.\n\nOver time, as we\u2019ve used these metrics, our interviewer quality has gone way up.\n\nIn this post, we\u2019ll explain exactly how we compute and use these metrics to get the best work out of our interviewers. In a [follow-up post](https://interviewing.io/blog/we-have-the-best-technical-interviewers-heres-how-we-do-it), we\u2019ll talk about how to bring some of these approaches and metrics to your own interview process.\n\nBefore we get into all that, I\u2019d like to provide some context about why these metrics are important, and why you can\u2019t assume that just because an interviewer comes from a great company, they\u2019ll be great at conducting interviews.\n\n## Interviewer quality generally sucks and isn\u2019t something companies really care about\n\nWe host thousands of interviews a month, and that means we need a lot of interviewers. But, as you saw above, we live and die by interviewer quality, so we need those interviewers to be world-class.\n\nWhen I first started interviewing.io, I assumed that if we were very picky about whom we let be an interviewer, then all of our interviewers would be great. These are the criteria we came up with and still use today:\n\n- Engineers from FAANG and FAANG-adjacent companies (e.g., Uber, Stripe, Dropbox)\n- At least 4 years of experience (though today the average on our platform is 8)\n- Conducted at least 20 interviews at FAANG or a FAANG-adjacent company\n\nAs we quickly learned, however, even these stringent criteria weren\u2019t enough. We found ourselves facing two problems. First, our users would regularly tell us that their interviewer didn\u2019t seem like they were paying attention, was a jerk, or didn\u2019t teach them anything useful. Second, over time, as interviewing.io became more popular and gained more users, we saw that our candidates weren\u2019t performing as well in real interviews as they previously had\u2026 which meant that our interviewers weren\u2019t as well calibrated as we thought.\n\nI could speculate at length about why just choosing interviewers from top companies isn\u2019t good enough, but my suspicion is that interviewer training is not created equal.\n\nSome companies invest considerable time and effort into teaching their interviewers how to be present during an interview, how to give hints, how to ask good follow-up questions, and how to make the candidate walk away feeling like they spent an hour working with a smart friend on a cool problem.\n\nOthers just throw new interviewers into the fray.\n\nSome companies, like Opendoor (whose [eng manager shared with us the notion of \u201csuperforecasters\u201d](https://interviewing.io/blog/technical-phone-screen-superforecasters) keep detailed metrics on which interviewers have the best eye for talent. But other companies shoot blind.\n\nEven with great training, some interviewers won\u2019t put in the work to stay present and engaged during interviews. Interviewing people is polarizing \u2014 some love it and some hate it \u2014 and if you don\u2019t love it, it\u2019ll show.\n\nWith this said, while our criteria might sound like a pretty high barrier to entry, the reality is that interviewer quality, before we instituted some formal metrics, was all over the place, both with respect to candidate experience and calibration.\n\nEnter the money-making metrics!\n\n## The need for two metrics\n\nAs you saw, we care about two separate things: how good of a candidate experience our interviewers create and how well-calibrated they are.\n\n**Candidate experience matters for retention.** We want engineers to complete as many mock interviews as they need on our platform. Some users will be ready after one mock, but others will need more practice. What we don\u2019t want is for someone to leave us before they\u2019re ready simply because they had a negative experience with their first (or second) interviewer.\n\nWe also care about retention on a multi-year timeline. We\u2019re a hiring marketplace, so we know that \u2014 like a dating site \u2014 if we do our job well, our users will leave us. Unlike a dating site, though, people today aren\u2019t married to their jobs. The average tenure of a software engineer in the US is 2.4 years. We hope that once our users are considering their next move, they\u2019ll come back to us to practice and de-rust.[2](#user-content-fn-2)\n\n**Calibration matters just as much as candidate experience.** I already talked about how the employers who hire through us are taking a leap of faith because they\u2019re agreeing to spend eng time on our candidates, sight unseen. Calibration and candidate experience are also inextricably linked \u2014 feedback that\u2019s too lenient might boost a candidate\u2019s confidence in the short term, but it will also hurt their chances of doing well in interviews, which ultimately reflects poorly on us.\n\nCandidate experience and calibration are related, but they\u2019re different enough to warrant tracking separately. We ultimately decided to create a \u201ccandidate experience\u201d score and a \u201ccalibration\u201d score for each interviewer and track them over time, both individually and in aggregate across the whole platform.\n\nFirst, how did we find the interviewers who drove customer success?\n\n### Metric 1: The candidate experience score\n\nAfter each interview on interviewing.io, we collect feedback from both candidates and interviewers. As you may recall, interviews are fully anonymous, and you don\u2019t see the other person\u2019s feedback until you submit yours. This means that on our platform, candidates are incentivized to tell us honestly how things went.\n\nThis is what our candidate feedback form looks like:\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/candidate_feedback_form_5e72f023da.png)\n\nThough we\u2019d been qualitatively tracking candidate feedback for years, we recently quantified it and created a per-interviewer candidate experience score. Here\u2019s what we did.\n\nRanking how well people engage customers is a wide-ranging task: similar questions could be asked about Uber drivers, Instacart shoppers, sales reps, or even schoolteachers.\n\nA core issue in customer-facing platforms is that customers are too\u2026 nice. There\u2019s grade inflation in the feedback. For example, Uber driver ratings are compressed at the top, with most drivers clustered around 4.8 or so. In absolute terms, a 4.8 seems not that different from a 4.7, but seasoned riders have learned the difference. Despite interviews being anonymous and feedback being mutually incentivized, it\u2019s true in our data as well: a seemingly high average in absolute terms could mask a chronic underperformer, so it\u2019s important to use relative rankings and concrete outcomes (e.g., customer churn) in addition to customer ratings.\n\nWhat did our score need to do? We saw three overarching attributes that needed to be balanced:\n\n- **Predictive**: Scores should capture something persistent about the interviewer\u2019s ability. Someone\u2019s score today should tell you something about their performance tomorrow.\n- **Fair**: Scores shouldn\u2019t feel arbitrary; they should be based on meaningful metrics and interviewers should be given space to improve.\n- **Legible**: Scores should be interpretable to both the interviewing.io ops team and to the interviewers themselves.\n\nOur first task was to check whether an interviewer-based metric was **predictive**. This wasn\u2019t guaranteed: most of the variation in the customer experience could be driven by the attitudes of the customers or extraneous factors like the weather that day. If this were the case, any ranking of interviewers would be entirely based on luck.\n\nInstead, we found evidence that interviewers had stable skill levels \u2014 someone\u2019s history of customer ratings was highly predictive of what the next customer would say about them. These results extended beyond just survey responses: customers who got paired with a lower-ranked interviewer were more likely to leave the platform entirely. A bad interviewer increased churn by almost 10 percentage points.\n\nThe graph below shows the result. If interviewers had no effect on churn, we would expect the fitted line to be flat. Instead, once we rank interviewers based on their past sessions, we can predict how likely a customer is to leave the platform after an interview with them. Around 30% of customers leave if they get an interviewer from the bottom fifth. But only 20% of customers leave if they get an interviewer from above the 80th percentile.\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/The_tight_link_between_interviewer_quality_and_candidate_attrition_9c2a88fccb.png)\n\nSo, interviewers had stable traits which, in the worst cases, could actually scare customers off the platform. Our next step was to condense this valuable information into a single score. Machine learning methods have one suggestion for this: use the interviewer identities as features in a model predicting a customer outcome like attrition or dissatisfaction. The coefficients could then be used as a measure of quality.\n\nWhile we did estimate these, a ranking based on these numbers wouldn\u2019t be very **legible**. At best, we could tell the interviewers that their quality scores were based on a well-calibrated model.\n\nIt turned out that averages of the more readily understood dimensions of customer feedback (how excited they are to work with them and the quality of the interview questions, hints, and communication) were closely correlated with the machine learning predictions. So to reduce the complexity in the score, we used the linear combination of the customer feedback factors that were most correlated with the output from the more complicated model.\n\nThus, we boiled down our optimal prediction into a simpler linear model that the interviewers could even calculate themselves, giving them insight into which components were holding them back. This would also help our ops team provide focused nudges to the interviewers.\n\nWas it **fair**? In general, the model\u2019s out-of-sample predictions were more accurate when it used all past interviewers in the data to train. This is unsurprising, but it meant that veteran interviewers who had shown recent improvement might have to wait a year for this to be reflected in their score. This low-score purgatory would be too demoralizing.\n\nAnother fairness concern was that interviewers in hot water with objectively high averages could complain that they\u2019d received only \u201cExcellent\u201d and \u201cGreat\u201d ratings, much like a 4.6-star Uber driver. **We emphasized to interviewers that these scores put them in the bottom 5-10% of interviewers, with real business consequences.**\n\nOne early challenge we faced was setting the right observation window. Originally, we decided to look at interviewers who had conducted at least 5 interviews in a rolling 90-day period. But because some interviewers had 5 in that 90-day period and others had 150, this created very different sample sizes and made it possible for a single interview to derail someone\u2019s score.\n\nAfter measuring the predictiveness of different look-back periods, we eventually decided to limit it to the most recent 30 interviews. We saw that, while more data was always better, the curve flattened around 30. Sessions older than that would be ignored so that interviewers on an upward trajectory would have this reflected in their scores.\n\n**Our final result was a simple linear function of someone\u2019s average customer feedback, with different weights according to how predictive that factor was of the machine learning estimates, and with the limited look-back period.**\nBelow, you can see our weighted (by number of interviews) aggregate candidate experience score across all the mock interviews on the platform. We track this as an internal health metric, and it\u2019s a remarkably useful metric that shows us how happy our users are, at a glance (and correlates very directly with NPS).\n\n### Metric 2: The accuracy score\n\nOutside of delivering great candidate experience, it\u2019s critical to our business that our interviewers are well-calibrated. After all, if our candidates aren\u2019t amazing, the companies who hire through us will stop giving precious eng time to interviewing our users. They\u2019ll just go back to using resumes.\n\nSo how much better do our candidates have to be?\n\nIn a good funnel at a company with a high engineering bar, candidates pass the technical screen about 20-25% of the time. Over time and after a bunch of trial and error, we realized that we needed our candidates to pass interviews about 70% of the time.[3](#user-content-fn-3) That\u2019s about 3X what our customers see in their funnels, and it\u2019s the threshold where working with us started to feel like magic. After all, when companies work with us, we\u2019re removing their ability to choose who they talk to. They just have to trust us\u2026 and that makes the psychological burden of proof higher than you might expect. 50% pass rate, for instance, wasn\u2019t enough to feel like magic.\n\nIn a nutshell, we had to ensure that our interviewers were well-calibrated enough to achieve a 70% passthrough rate for our candidates in real interviews.\n\nFortunately, we had the data to make this happen.\n\nOn interviewing.io, engineers do mock interviews, and top performers do real ones. Both sets of interviews have an identical feedback form that the interviewer completes after each interview:\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/interviewer_feedback_form_bd43d2e5c3.png)\n\nTo figure out how \u201caccurate\u201d our mock interviewers were \u2014 a measure of whether their judgments tended to be too strict, too lenient, or well-calibrated, relative to the hiring decisions of companies \u2014 we compared how they rated their candidates to how those candidates performed later, in real interviews.\n\nIn other words, this was based on a similar principle as the interviewer quality score, although based on less subjective measures than customer feedback.\n\nUsing just the interviewers\u2019 own ratings and decisions of hiring companies, we asked whether some interviewers regularly under- or overestimated their candidates compared to candidates\u2019 subsequent interviews with real companies. The answer was yes, and this result persisted in out-of-sample testing.\n\nMuch like the customer feedback, our interviewers had a bigger problem with positivity: the overly positive interviewers indicated they would hire their candidates 75% of the time, while their candidates received a yes just 60% of the time in real interviews \u2014 a considerable gap. But a sizable portion of well-calibrated interviewers closely matched the judgments of companies, and we told them so.\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Interviewer_accuracy_and_their_disagreement_with_real_job_interviews_df13562638.png)\n\nOur accuracy calculations were a continuous score, but we wanted to condense this. We converged on a -4 to 4 scale, a small number of values that we could connect to a distinct message. People with a 0 are among the best-calibrated interviewers. People with 3s and 4s are definitely too positive: they\u2019re almost twice as likely to want to hire someone compared to the company. People with negative values are similarly too negative.\n\n## How these scores play together, or why brutal honesty makes for great candidate experience\n\nOnce we built out both sets of scores, we could finally answer a question that interviewers new to our platform pose regularly: Is there a tension between delivering great candidate experience and being brutally honest with candidates about their performance?\n\nAfter all, doesn\u2019t candidate experience depend, in part, on NOT giving harsh, unvarnished feedback? And doesn\u2019t failing people create a bad experience that makes them not want to return?\n\nFortunately, for hard questions like these, we have the data! Below is a graph of average candidate experience score as a function of interviewer accuracy, representing data from over 1,000 interviewers. As you can see, the candidate experience score peaks right at the point where interviewers are neither too strict or too lenient but are, in Goldilocks terms, just right. It drops off pretty dramatically on either side after that.[4](#user-content-fn-4)\n\n## How we used these scores to significantly improve candidate experience over time\n\nIn the graph at the bottom of the \u201ccandidate experience score\u201d section, you can see that starting in Q1 of 2022, our aggregate candidate experience score improved dramatically. This was intentional. Once we realized how well this metric predicted both candidate experience and attrition, we started to actively drive it up. Here\u2019s what we did:\n\n- Systematically, ruthlessly paused interviewers who fell below the bar\n- Created full transparency and visibility around both scores\n- Built automatic throttling\n- Started running monthly onboarding meetings to explain our business model to interviewers and share how both candidate experience and accurate vetting are critical to interviewing.io\u2019s success\n\n### Ruthlessly pausing interviewers below the bar\n\nOnce we built both scores, we started to use them to filter out underperforming interviewers.\n\nFor candidate experience, we chose a line below which candidate attrition was unacceptable. If an interviewer toed that line, we would reach out and encourage them to improve their performance. If an interviewer consistently fell below that line, then we paused their ability to do interviews.\n\nWe took a similar approach to accuracy. If an interviewer was too strict or too lenient (below a -1 or above a 1), we issued a warning and ultimately paused. In a pinch, we\u2019d keep the strict interviewers and just let go of the lenient ones.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to frame letting people go in a really positive light, but it\u2019s important to distinguish between the two abilities in question here. As often seen in sports, the best players are not necessarily the best coaches. Similarly, we were forced to cut some really stellar *engineers* who, regrettably, didn\u2019t have the disposition or interpersonal skills to be great mentors.\n\nAs we started to roll out our new, ruthless policy of letting go underperformers, we realized that we had made a mistake. Though interviewers\u2019 scores were visible to us, they were not visible to interviewers, so when we started issuing warnings, they were often blindsided and not in a place where they could take the news well.\n\n### Transparency and visibility\n\nTo fix the problem and not blindside our interviewers, we made a dashboard where interviewers could see both their \u201ccandidate experience\u201d and \u201caccuracy\u201d scores in near-real time (for accuracy, we bucketed the score into \u201ctoo strict,\u201d \u201cOK,\u201d and \u201ctoo lenient\u201d). We also shared how we calculate both scores.\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image_15dafbf507.png)\n\nExposing the scores, as well as the logic behind them, helped our interviewer community buy into the scoring system and to see firsthand that it was built on data and not our subjective opinions. It also made it so no one was shocked when we reached out about their performance. Over time, we started encouraging interviewers to come to us if they saw their score slipping\u2026 before we had the chance to reach out to them.\n\n### Automatic throttling\n\nHaving our ops team manually review interviewer scores every week and manually pause underperforming interviewers obviously didn\u2019t scale, so we decided to build a throttling system that would put our best interviewers in front of the most customers. That meant adjusting our interview scheduling algorithm to prioritize interviewers who maintained higher ratings. Those rated lower still got assignments but only if higher-rated interviewers weren\u2019t available for the same type of interview or time slot. The net result is the top 20% of our interviewers administering 80% of practice interviews.\n\nNew interviewers still get the chance to prove their mettle, of course.\n\n### Monthly onboarding\n\nAs we spoke to more and more interviewers, it became clear that many of them didn\u2019t actually know what interviewing.io did or why candidate experience and accuracy mattered so much to our bottom line.\n\nWhen I first started the company, I\u2019d spend 30-60 minutes on the phone with every new interviewer, explaining how hiring was broken and how they played a critical part in fixing it. Then, at some point, we started growing fast, and I stopped.\n\nIt was clearly time to start again. Though it was no longer sustainable for me to do 1:1 calls, I now run a 1.25-hour monthly onboarding session along with our ops team, and every interviewer who\u2019s joined our community since the last session has to attend.\n\nIn these sessions, we discuss a bunch of the stuff covered in this post. We talk about the mission of the company, why the two metrics matter, how to deliver harsh feedback, how important it is not to sugarcoat things, and what it means to be a good interviewer.\n\nExplaining what we do, why we do it, and how high our expectations are made a step function difference in the quality of our interviewer community. It also reaffirmed my faith in humanity. If you want people to do a great job, tell them what a great job looks like and why it matters. And if you\u2019re fortunate enough to have talented people working for you who are committed to your mission, they will knock it out of the park.\n\nIn the next post (coming soon), we\u2019ll talk about how to bring some of these approaches and metrics to your own interview process. Because you are a single company, not a dedicated interview platform, you may not be able to replicate what we did exactly, but you can get pretty close with just a little bit of work.\n\n*Big thank you to Maxim Massenkoff, Liz Graves, and Richard Graves for their contributions to and help with this post.*\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. Thankfully, our candidates are better. On average, interviewing.io top performers perform 3X better in technical interviews than candidates from other sources (70% pass rate compared to 20-25%, the latter being the industry standard at companies with a high bar). [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n2. We\u2019re proud to say that 70% of our users return to interviewing.io for their next job search. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-2)\n3. While we could go higher than 70%, we didn\u2019t want to have too many false negatives, which aren\u2019t great for business or for candidate experience. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-3)\n4. There are some notable peculiarities in the data as well. For instance, why do interviewers with an accuracy score of -3 get rated so much worse than interviewers who are even more strict? And why does candidate experience keep improving ever so slightly, as interviewers get more and more lenient, only to drop off again at the most lenient (accuracy = 4)? I expect these are functions of needing more data and that if we had, say, 10K interviewers in our ecosystem, the curve would be a lot more smooth.

Our predictions for 2024.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: December 10, 2023; Last updated: December 7, 2024\n\n**EDIT**: *If you don't like reading, here's me presenting the contents of this blog post in a video. Pick your poison.*\n\nPredictions are hard, and, inevitably, most of them turn out wrong. But we\u2019d like to brave the scathing mockery of the internets and try anyway! Our courage is bolstered by some useful data we have (both proprietary and gathered from the internet), which we\u2019ll use to guess what will happen in 2024 and to answer the question foremost in many of our minds: *\u201cWhen is hiring coming back?*\u201d\n\ninterviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform and recruiting marketplace for engineers. Engineers use us for mock interviews. Companies use us to hire top performers. In our lifetime, we\u2019ve hosted over 100k technical interviews, split between mocks and real ones. **Data from these interviews helps us get an insider\u2019s perspective on what\u2019s actually going on in the engineering market. For instance, we know how many people are practicing for interviews at Google vs. Meta vs. other FAANGs. Because we offer salary negotiation, we know how often people are negotiating, how successful they are, and what their compensation looks like. We also know what the \u201cbar\u201d looks like in different kinds of technical interviews over time \u2014 how well you have to do to pass algorithmic interviews, system design interviews, and so on.**\n\nAnd, finally, we ran several surveys with our users recently (thank you, kind and patient users), to learn about their recent job searches and outcomes. We also asked our users to share some advice based on their experience with the current job market. We\u2019ll include bits of advice as quotes throughout this piece.\n\nPutting all of this data together gives us the kind of clarity that wouldn\u2019t be possible from looking at any one piece individually. For instance, once you realize that most FAANGs are only hiring for backfills, while Meta is on a hiring spree, you start to understand why they\u2019ve been treating candidates poorly and why the market has allowed them to do it. We\u2019ll get to all of that in a bit. First, here\u2019s Nostradamus Corgi with our predictions for 2024.\n\n## Predictions for 2024\n\n![Nostradamus Corgi](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nostradamus_Corgi_c5e6d122c7.png)\n\nThose who've owned a touch bar MacBook with butterfly keyboard will appreciate that a hologram-snow-globe provides a vastly superior input device.\n\n**Prediction #1: 2024 is the year when hiring comes back.**  \nWhether we like it or not, the FAANGs are driving overall eng hiring volume. As you\u2019ll soon learn, Meta and Netflix are hiring aggressively while the other FAANGs are not, but I\u2019m inclined to think that come next year, most of the FAANGs will follow Meta and Netflix\u2019s lead and start actively hiring again.\n\n**Prediction #2: Mid-level & senior eng hiring will pick up significantly, come Jan 2024.**  \nWe\u2019re less confident about this part, but we expect that hiring will be back to (or quite close to) H1 2022 levels in the spring of 2024.\n\n**Prediction #3: For at least the next 6 months, compensation at a given level will stay flat.**\n\n**Prediction #4: For at least the next 6 months, down-leveling will continue because of inertia.**\n\n**Prediction #5: For at least the next 6 months, recruiters are going to be increasingly stretched thin, which means that applying online is going to be an even less effective way to get into companies.**\n\n**Prediction #6: The hiring bar will NOT return to where it was for a long time.**\n\nOf course, anybody on the internet can make predictions about hiring, but ours are supported by actual data (below), which we want you to dive into to see if you agree with us. And at the end of this piece, we\u2019ll include a final bonus prediction and actionable advice and resources you can use to capitalize on these predictions.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at some benchmarks from the broader internet about the state of hiring and layoffs.\n\n## Eng jobs are recovering, and layoffs are way down\n\nBelow is a graph of open tech jobs over time, from TrueUp. TrueUp indexes open jobs at \u201ctech and tech-ish companies\u201d that have one or both of the following traits: \u201cproduct + services would not exist without the internet\u201d and/or \u201craised money from a VC\u201d.\n\n![Number of open tech jobs at tech startups, tech unicorns, and public tech companies ](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Number_of_open_tech_jobs_be3f1062fe.png)\n\nSource: <https://www.trueup.io/job-trend>\n\nAs you can see, tech jobs started to drop in May 2022 (around the time the FAANGs froze hiring) and began to recover slowly in March 2023.\n\nAt the same time, layoffs are way down after peaking in Q1 2023. The number of people laid off is down 88%, and companies doing layoffs are down 68%. **Most importantly, layoffs have solidly returned to pre-downturn levels.**[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n\n![Number of tech employees laid off each quarter ](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Tech_employees_laid_off_f5bea7bcdf.png)\n\nSource: layoffs.fyi; Q4 projections are ours\n\n**So, tech jobs are recovering and layoffs are way down. Woohoo!**\n\nBack to open tech jobs for a moment. When we saw fewer people booking mock interviews in 2022, we started to use the TrueUp graph as a sanity check to learn if it was just us. Turns out\u2026 it\u2019s not just us. Here is the same graph from above, overlaid with mock interview purchases on interviewing.io. We\u2019ve hidden the y-axis values because we\u2019re not comfortable sharing our exact sales numbers with the world, but the shape of the graph is what matters most here.\n\n![interviewing.io purchases and number of open tech jobs are related](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/iio_purchases_and_number_of_open_tech_jobs_related_1cc780f368.png)\n\nSource: <https://www.trueup.io/job-trend> and proprietary interviewing.io data\n\nAlong with feeling some relief that we weren\u2019t entirely to blame for fucking up our business and could, in good conscience, cast some blame on macroeconomic conditions, we also noticed another interesting thing \u2014 **purchases on our platform mirror what\u2019s going on in the broader market and effectively give us insight into hiring trends.**\n\nIf you believe, like we do, that purchase activity is a good proxy, then we can conclude that **eng jobs appear to be recovering faster than tech jobs as a whole. In the graph above, hiring started turning around in January 2023 and has grown 58% since then, with most of the growth happening between Q3 and Q4 of this year.**\n\nWe\u2019ll be using interviewing.io purchase activity as a proxy for open eng jobs for the rest of the post.\n\n## What\u2019s going on at specific FAANGs?\n\nAs you\u2019ll see in the next few sections, our mock interview purchase data is tightly coupled to events in the outside world. In addition to learning what\u2019s going on with hiring as a whole, our data shows us what\u2019s going on at specific companies, letting us see which ones are actively hiring and how much. We can clearly see when various companies freeze, go on hiring sprees, or just start hiring a little bit. Since many of our users are preparing specifically for FAANGs, we\u2019ll start there.\n\nWe\u2019ve done our best to corroborate the trends we\u2019re seeing in our data with insiders at these companies, but that doesn\u2019t mean we haven\u2019t missed something or made mistakes. If something looks incorrect, we want to hear from you, and we\u2019ll fix it. Just email [hello@interviewing.io](mailto:hello@interviewing.io).\n\n### Google\n\nBelow is a graph of Google-specific purchasing activity on interviewing.io over time. (As before, we\u2019ve hidden y-axis values, but what matters most is the shape of the graph.) As you can see, it tracks with what was happening in the world \u2014 Google slowed their hiring in May 2022, along with other companies like Uber, and [officially froze hiring in July](https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/20/23271634/google-hiring-pause-two-weeks-review-headcount-needs).\n\n![Mock interview purchases over time for Google](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Mock_interview_purchases_over_time_for_Google_e1498fc2d0.png)\n\nSource: Proprietary interviewing.io data\n\n**Since then, Google\u2019s hiring continued to slow, falling 90% from peak and 50% since January of this year, until it finally leveled out around July. The latest news we\u2019ve heard is that while Google is currently hiring, it\u2019s primarily backfills for attrition rather than new headcount.**\n\nWant to know if you\u2019re ready to interview at Google? Do anonymous mock interviews with real Google interviewers, and see exactly where you stack up.\n\n[See available times](https://interviewing.io/signup)\n\n![](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcta.47351a0d.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\n### Meta\n\n![Mock interview purchases over time for Google and Meta](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Mock_interview_purchases_overtime_for_Google_and_Meta_b5d62232e5.png)\n\nSource: Proprietary interviewing.io data\n\nLike Google, Meta froze hiring in 2022 (they actually did it before Google \u2013 it was officially announced in [May](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-is-freezing-hiring-heres-why-and-who-it-impacts-2022-5)). **However, unlike Google, they\u2019re currently hiring aggressively, and if you believe that mock interview purchases are a good proxy for hiring volume, they\u2019re up about 800% since January of this year, and are now back to pre-freeze levels (though not yet back to peak).**\n\nSome anecdotal data we have backs this up. At interviewing.io, we offer salary negotiation help to our users, which means that we talk to a lot of people, in depth, about where they\u2019re interviewing and how it\u2019s going. Almost every negotiation candidate we\u2019ve had recently has been interviewing at Meta. What\u2019s even more interesting is the volume of possible teams that candidates talk to during team matching. Earlier this year, Meta\u2019s story seemed to be:\n\n> *We\u2019re primarily hiring for backfills. These are the 1-2 teams that might have open headcount. You gotta decide fast, or those slots will be filled.*\n\nNow, our users are regularly presented with more than 10 teams to choose from.\n\nMeta\u2019s hiring boom, relative to most other FAANGs\u2019 conservative hiring, has one notable dark side. Meta\u2019s hiring volume is clearly outpacing all the other FAANGs (Netflix is also up, but Meta\u2019s eng team is more than 10X the size of Netflix\u2019s, so in the absolute, Netflix\u2019s hiring volume isn\u2019t enough to balance Meta out) \u2014 for all intents and purposes they\u2019re the only FAANG that\u2019s really hiring at scale \u2014 so they\u2019re currently getting away with treating candidates really poorly.\n\nWe\u2019ll talk more about this in the down-leveling section, but Meta has capitalized on the market imbalance and has been rampantly down-leveling candidates, presumably because they can \u2014 in the pre-downturn market, competition would have made that difficult, but now, given that they\u2019re responsible for much of the FAANG hiring volume, they can rely on their candidates not having many comparable counteroffers and can present candidates with low-ball offers.\n\nOutside of down-leveling, which, in fairness, doesn\u2019t happen to every candidate, Meta also has changed their stance on negotiation.\n\nBefore the downturn, it was basically enough to say that you were interviewing at Google to get a signing bonus (or a higher signing bonus). Now, Meta will not lead with signing bonuses unless you\u2019ve been down-leveled, in which case they\u2019ll use them as a consolation prize of sorts (still cheaper for them because it\u2019s a conditional one-time payment). Moreover, Meta will not negotiate unless you can show higher counteroffers (they don\u2019t actually make you show the paperwork, but they ask for details). Recruiters have been trained to say, \u201cI\u2019ll go to bat for you and take this to the compensation committee, but only if you can show me a compelling reason, i.e., other offers.\u201d If you can\u2019t show other offers, they will not budge a dime.\n\nFinally, Meta has gotten much more aggressive with offer deadlines. Recruiters will push you to sign within a day or two of completing team matching and getting your offer numbers.\n\nThese kinds of high-pressure, candidate-unfriendly hiring practices would have been unthinkable in a more competitive hiring market, but right now Meta can get away with it. I would argue that their strategy is shortsighted, however, because this kind of market instability can\u2019t last long, and when the other FAANGs are back, Meta will start to see serious attrition from the engineers they\u2019ve down-leveled and low-balled. I\u2019m sure Meta talent execs have made this decision with their eyes open and are prepared to take the hit, but shame on them nevertheless, and I hope that the talent drain they experience next year is swift and brutal. Sorry, reader, I don\u2019t usually insert my opinions in a primarily data-driven piece, but the kind of unnecessary stress and sleepless nights their shortsighted policies have created for our users, who are highly competent, thoughtful, and kind senior engineers, makes my blood boil.\n\n**TL;DR: [Meta is on a hiring spree](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/meta-facebook#meta-facebook), and it\u2019s created an unstable equilibrium, which means that likely the other FAANGs will start hiring again soon. More on that later.**\n\nWant to know if you\u2019re ready to interview at Meta?

After both Google and Meta froze hiring in summer of 2022, Amazon went on an opportunistic hiring spree, and again, you can see in the graph above that mock interview purchase patterns do indeed reflect what\u2019s going on in the outside world.\n\n**After a few months of basically a monopoly on eng hiring, Amazon pulled back and froze in [November 2022](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/03/amazon-exec-confirms-corporate-hiring-freeze-through-end-of-year/). They\u2019ve been flat since January of 2023 and, from what we\u2019ve heard, are only hiring for backfills and very senior roles.**\n\nIt is rare to see one FAANG deviate drastically from the others when it comes to hiring, whether aggressively hiring when everyone else has paused or pausing when everyone else is hiring. It creates an unstable equilibrium, one that can\u2019t last very long. We\u2019ll talk a bit more about this later.\n\nWant to know if you\u2019re ready to interview at Amazon?

That said, we have been offering **Netflix practice since the beginning of 2023, and since then, demand** (and [Netflix hiring](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/netflix#netflix)) **appears to have grown, up almost 300% since January.**\n\n![Mock interview purchases over time for Netflix](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Mock_interview_purchases_over_time_for_Netflix_1cb05d59f9.png)\n\nSource: Proprietary interviewing.io data\n\nWant to know if you\u2019re ready to interview at Netflix?

In cases where we\u2019ve written guides for these companies\u2019 interview processes, I\u2019ve linked to them in the doc as well.\n\n[![List of companies hiring in Q4 2023](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/List_of_companies_hiring_in_q4_2023_defad29b21.png)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1icCMfo3NQk-UqL6GJrQxYkebz0UUIayiGfGL3YZGpck/edit#gid=0)\n  \nIt appears that despite the slowdowns and primarily just hiring for backfills, FAANG is still dominating \u2014 over half of our users are interviewing at FAANG companies, with startups comprising only 17% of interview volume.\n![Where interviewing.io users are interviewing](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Where_our_users_are_interviewing_d34e61755b.png)\n\n## Salary negotiation: an important trailing indicator\n\nBefore we analyze all these disparate FAANG data points and connect them to our 2024 predictions, we have a few more important pieces of data to share with you. One of them is around salary negotiation, a useful and important trailing indicator.\nAt interviewing.io, in addition to providing mock interviews, we provide help with salary negotiation. I do a lot of these sessions myself (it\u2019s one of the most rewarding parts of my job), and leading these sessions gives me a direct line to our users and ultimately an invaluable ear to the ground. Users share with us where they\u2019re interviewing, how it\u2019s going, what their offers look like with respect to both compensation and level, and more.\n\nI\u2019ll talk more about what we\u2019ve learned in these conversations (in aggregate, of course) later in the post, but for now, I\u2019d like to share how our salary negotiation business has changed over time and what insights these changes give us into the broader market.\n\nBelow is a graph of salary negotiation requests over time on interviewing.io (a request is someone booking salary negotiation help \u2014 they put down a credit card but don\u2019t have to pay anything unless the negotiation is successful, so we don\u2019t call them purchases like we did with mock interviews above).\n\n![Salary negotiation requests over time](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Salary_Negotiation_Requests_Over_Time_18316fcf2f.png)\n\nSource: Proprietary interviewing.io data\n\nThere are a few important things that immediately jump out in this graph. First, you can see that salary negotiation requests were at a relative high in June 2022 (the data we have from before isn\u2019t shown because we were logging activity differently). Then they took a nose-dive in November 2022 (dropping by 4X). Compare that to mock interview purchases over time above. You can see that salary negotiation activity has roughly a 3-month delay on mock interview activity, which makes sense because people tend to start thinking about negotiation around the time it looks like they\u2019re going to get an offer, whereas they start practicing much earlier.\n\nThough negotiation requests are still not up to peak levels, they\u2019ve been growing steadily and have 2X\u2019ed since the start of 2023.\n\nOne other bit of anecdotal negotiation data confirms that hiring is on the rise \u2014 we have seen our candidates interviewing with roughly 2X more companies in Q3 and Q4 than in Q1.\n\nBecause of the delay between practice (and ultimately real interviews) and negotiation, salary negotiation requests are a trailing indicator. In other words, these changes in salary negotiations are only observable after hiring volume has already shifted. **Therefore, they don\u2019t predict changes in hiring volume but rather confirm them after they have already occurred and ultimately help demonstrate that the growth we\u2019ve seen in hiring volume is not a fluke.**\n\n## What about compensation? And are people negotiating their salaries in this climate?\n\nWe talked a bit already about the kinds of insights we get from our salary negotiation program, both qualitatively and quantitatively. One of the quantitative pieces is offer sizes, broken down by cash, equity, and bonuses.\n\nBelow is average total compensation (initial offers, before negotiating, just for public companies, as we don\u2019t presume to accurately value private company equity) among our users over time. As you can see, it has largely stayed flat, despite the downturn.\n\n![Average initial offers over time](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Average_initial_offers_over_time_e4f1c58592.png)\n\nSource: Proprietary interviewing.io data\n\nWe were also fortunate to get a data set from the folks at [comprehensive.io](https://comprehensive.io), a source of comp data from the maker of [layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi). What we really liked about this data set is that it had engineering salaries for the kinds of eng roles that our users were actually targeting, in the locations where they were likely to work (if you look at broader aggregators, you\u2019ll see that the numbers are much lower than you\u2019d expect because they factor in engineering-adjacent positions in non-tech hubs).\n\n![Software engineer salaries stayed flat throughout 2023](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Eng_salaries_stayed_flat_throughout_2023_45916eef35.png)\n\nSource: [comprehensive.io](http://comprehensive.io) (from the maker of layoffs.fyi)\n\nAs you can see, comprehensive.io\u2019s data backs up what we\u2019ve seen among our negotiation users \u2014 compensation has indeed stayed flat despite the downturn.\n\nHere are a few tidbits not visible in the graphs above:\n\n- **We have NOT seen a difference in the average increase from successful negotiations.**\n- **That said, it\u2019s now much harder to negotiate successfully without multiple offers than in H1 2022.** It used to be enough to say that you\u2019re interviewing at a few high-profile companies and that if you get meaningfully more comp, you\u2019ll stop (basically companies would pay you to stop interviewing). Nowadays, companies are less likely to pay to get you off the market and will insist on needing at least one other offer to justify a comp increase (as you saw above with Meta).\n- **Companies are much less likely to lead with a signing bonus.** Instead, they\u2019ll leave them in their back pocket and only pull them out if necessary. One notable exception is scenarios where the engineer got down-leveled (more on that later). In those cases, companies might soften the blow by offering a meaningful signing bonus.\n\n> *\u201cThe market is really making things difficult. Expect things to be a bit harder and the offers to be lower than previous years. Negotiating is going to be absolutely crucial \u2014 now more than ever.\u201d*\n\n## The changing role of recruiters, and the very practical thing it means for you\n\nTake a look at the graph below. The black curve is the same one we first shared above, when we graphed it against total open tech jobs \u2014 it\u2019s total mock interview purchases on interviewing.io, which we have found to be a good proxy for the state of eng hiring (we\u2019re using this graph and not the one from trueup.io because the latter doesn\u2019t specifically show engineering jobs, and seeing engineering jobs specifically matters for the point we\u2019re about to make). As before, we\u2019ve hidden the y-axis values to protect our business.\n\nSince the start of the year, mock interview purchases (and resulting eng jobs) have grown by 58%.\n\n![Software engineer jobs are recovering, recruiter jobs are not](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Eng_jobs_vs_recruiter_jobs_a1cdbe8e46.png)\n\nSource: interviewing.io proprietary data and [lightcast.io](https://lightcast.io)\n\nThe dark blue line is new. It\u2019s the number of open tech recruiter jobs over time. As you can see, engineering jobs are recovering, but recruiter jobs are not (and because this isn\u2019t our proprietary data, we\u2019ve included numbers on the right y-axis). In fact, since the start of the year, open recruiter jobs have shrunk by 52%.\n\nWe\u2019ll talk about the implications of this disparity in a moment, but before we do that, let\u2019s look at one more graph:\n\n![Rise in inbound applications in business and technical roles](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/business_and_technical_roles_apps_ef78404990.png)\n\nSource: [Ashby\u2019s 2023 Trends Report | Applications Per Job](https://www.ashbyhq.com/talent-trends-report/reports/2023-trends-report-applications-per-job?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=Ashby+Keyword&utm_term=ashbyhq))\n\nThis graph comes from Ashby, a new applicant tracking system (ATS) that\u2019s used by a growing number of startups and tech companies. Because they\u2019re an ATS, they have a treasure trove of data about who applies to what jobs, when. As you can see, the number of applicants for technical roles held steady from 2021 to 2022, and then it began to creep up before it hit a serious growth inflection point at the end of 2022. Though Ashby\u2019s graph only goes up to April 2023, since the start of 2023, inbound applications for technical positions have doubled.\n\n**Plainly put, the number of eng positions recruiters are responsible for filling is increasing, and the volume of applicants is growing, while the number of recruiters among whom that work is distributed is shrinking.**\n\nYou might argue that recruiters might not end up having to do more work because this disparity will force them to rely even more on automated filtering of applications. This may very well be true. However, whether increasingly harried recruiters will take less time to review inbound applicants or whether this is an opportunity for a new wave of resume-filtering solutions, one thing is clear. While applying online has always been a pretty BAD IDEA \u2014 because it\u2019s the moral equivalent of shouting into a black hole \u2014 it\u2019s more true now than ever before.\n\nIn addition to the market data above, we have some anecdotal info and survey results. In our survey that preceded this post, 17% of senior engineers cited that getting in the door was the hardest part of their job search, even harder than technical interviews.\n\nFinally, eng leaders we\u2019ve spoken to have confirmed their recruiting teams (and sometimes their eng teams) are overwhelmed with inbound applications.\n\n**So, do not apply online in this climate, full stop.** Instead, reach out to hiring managers \u2014 recruiters are not incentivized to break rules and will likely not get back to you, especially if you don\u2019t look perfect on paper. Moreover, the numbers will be on your side, as relatively few candidates are targeting hiring managers directly. We plan to write a full blog post on how to do this kind of outreach well, but this CliffsNotes version will get you started:\n\n- Get a LinkedIn Sales Navigator account\n- Make a target list of hiring managers at the companies you\u2019re interested in\n- Figure out their emails (you can use a tool like RocketReach), and send them something personalized. Do not use LinkedIn. The same way that you don\u2019t live in LinkedIn, eng managers don\u2019t either.\n\nSome advice from our users about getting in the door:\n\n> *\u201cBe prepared, and also be proactive. Don't just wait for the recruiters to contact you.\u201d*\n\n> *\u201cNetworking is key. If you know the name of the person who will be interviewing you, research them online to try to get a feel for who they are and what types of questions they might ask.\u201d*\n\n## Down-leveling\n\nAs I mentioned above, Meta has been brazen in their down-leveling of candidates. It usually manifests as a down-level (e.g., you interview for an E5 role and then end up at an E4). This kind of down-leveling has happened to almost every negotiation client we've had who has interviewed at Meta.\n\nMaking matters worse, we've found that it's virtually impossible to negotiate without another offer on the table. It doesn't necessarily have to be from another FAANG, but it needs to be from a notable FAANG-adjacent company.\n\nBasically Meta's approach post-downturn has been as follows:\n\n- Interview someone\n- Down-level them, citing poor performance in system design interviews\n- Make them a lowball offer even for that band but compensate for it with a decent signing bonus (~$50-70k) as a way to soften the blow and make it more likely candidates will accept quickly\n- Refuse to negotiate unless candidates show them other offers: \"I can't take this to the compensation committee without a compelling reason, i.e., another offer.\"\n\nThough we\u2019d argue Meta has drawn the hardest line with respect to negotiation, as discussed above, they\u2019re not the only company that\u2019s down-leveling candidates. **According to our survey, of the people who got offers in 2023, 33% were down-leveled.**\n\n**We didn\u2019t have enough data for Apple and Amazon, but using our survey results, we\u2019ve computed the probability of getting down-leveled at the rest of the FAANGs, given that you receive an offer there.** At Netflix, it\u2019s 50%. At Meta, it\u2019s 55%. At Google, it\u2019s 59%, and finally at Microsoft it\u2019s a whopping 66%. Again, although Meta\u2019s down-leveling percentage isn\u2019t as high as Microsoft\u2019s, they\u2019re hiring far more engineers, so their actions have a much greater effect on the marketplace.\n\n![Probability of being down-leveled by FAANG companies](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Probability_of_being_down_leveled_by_FAANG_74be6f98df.png)\n\nSource: interviewing.io survey data\n\n**For all other companies (small startups, large startups, and FAANG-adjacent), the probability of getting down-leveled is about 37%.** Almost everyone we heard from was down-leveled by just one level, but we saw a handful of people drop by two levels.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect with the rise down-leveling, the bar for interview performance has been going up as well, and this rising bar accounts for some of the down-leveling we\u2019re seeing (though we expect that cost savings for the employers who are doing it accounts for much of the rest).\n\n## The rising bar\n\nThe rising bar makes sense \u2014 after all, more engineers are competing for relatively fewer positions. Because we have a bunch of interview data, we are actually able to quantify the increase.\n\nSpecifically, after every interview on our platform, whether it\u2019s a mock or a real one, the interviewer leaves feedback. The feedback form looks like this, and it includes a yes/no question for whether they\u2019d move the candidate forward, as well as star ratings of their performance on a scale of 1 to 4, where 4 is best. These star ratings cover 3 areas: coding ability, problem-solving ability, and communication skills.\n\n![interviewing.io feedback form](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/feedback_93fb5e447f.png)\n\nTo track how the bar has changed, we can look at the average coding and problem-solving ratings for successful interviews over time (we haven\u2019t focused on communication ability because we previously discovered that it doesn\u2019t significantly affect interview outcomes except for very senior roles).\n\n![The bar for coding ability and problem solving continue to rise](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Bar_for_coding_ability_and_problem_solving_ed03a59d2f.png)\n\nSource: Proprietary interviewing.io data, based on tens of thousands of interviews\n\nAs you can see above, the coding and problem-solving scores for successful interviews have risen steadily since the start of 2022. To make these numbers concrete, you now need to perform 22% better in technical interviews than you did at the start of last year (with respect to both coding and problem solving). [The last time we wrote about the rising bar was in November 2022](https://interviewing.io/blog/you-now-need-to-do-15-percent-better-in-technical-interviews), and back then you had to do 15% better. The bar has only continued to go up.\n\nWe came up with these numbers after bucketing interview performance into percentiles (more realistic than just looking at average raw scores because relative differences in raw scores may amount to much larger or smaller differences when competing against other engineers). At the start of 2022, you had to be in the 65th percentile to pass interviews, namely outperform 65% of engineers. At the end of 2022, you had to be in the 78th percentile, and now you have to be in the 83rd.\n\nThis data is corroborated by our users\u2019 experience with the job market. In our survey, we asked our users if they felt that the bar was higher and/or the interview process was more difficult than the last time they were interviewing, 77% said yes.\n\n## Bonus prediction about AI\n\n**Prediction #7: For a long time in the future, we won\u2019t see major changes to interview styles, despite the advent of ChatGPT. We will, however, see changes to interview questions.** Specifically:\n\n- Companies will have to move away from asking verbatim LeetCode questions because of how easy it is to cheat.\n- Similarly, we expect that async coding tests will go away for the same reason.\n- There will be a premium on good human interviewers.\n\nThis final prediction might feel a bit random, as we haven\u2019t discussed AI at all till now, but we\u2019ve been doing some experimentation on how tools like ChatGPT are going to change technical interviewing. We\u2019ll publish details soon, and we decided to include the AI predictions in this post because the topic is too salient not to.\n\n## Predictions recap\n\nWe\u2019re currently in the eye of an unstable period. It\u2019s simply not sustainable for most FAANGs to just be backfilling while Meta and Netflix plow ahead with 2022-level hiring volume. Though Amazon did something similar in 2022, unstable equilibria like this don\u2019t last. Sure, you could make the argument that Meta and Netflix will just freeze again (like Amazon did, after their hiring spree), but between the recent rise in mock interview bookings overall, the increase in salary negotiation requests, and the huge drop in layoffs, it seems likelier that next year the other FAANGs will join Meta and Netflix in actively hiring again.\n\nHere are some key data points that support our predictions:\n\n- Meta and Netflix mock interview bookings, and subsequent hiring, are way up (+800% and +300% respectively). Again, having only 2 FAANGs hiring is untenable because this type of unstable equilibrium can\u2019t last long.\n- Open tech jobs are growing (+14% since Feb 2023).\n- Tech layoffs are down, and specifically the number of people laid off is -93% since Jan 2023.\n- Mock interview bookings are growing (+58% since Jan 2023).\n- Salary negotiation is up 100% (trailing indicator).\n\nEven though hiring is going to come back, it\u2019s not going to feel quite like the heady days of 2021 and early 2022. The bar is going to stay high for the foreseeable future \u2014 as you saw, it\u2019s up 22% over the start of 2022, and walking that kind of thing back takes a long time.\n\nSimilarly, until most of the FAANGs are back to their pre-downturn hiring velocity, which will probably take at least 6 months, we will continue to see down-leveling, not just because of the rising bar but, frankly, because companies can get away with it while candidates have less leverage. For the same reason, salaries will continue to stay flat \u2014 they\u2019ve been flat for so long, despite market changes, that until we\u2019re firing on all cylinders again, inertia will keep them there.\n\nFinally, as hiring recovers, more recruiters will get hired back, but that, too, will take some time. For at least the next 6 months, recruiters will continue to be overworked, which means that, for the foreseeable future, applying online is going to be a fool\u2019s errand.\n\n## Actionable advice and resources\n\nWe have every reason to believe that by H2 of 2024, hiring will be back to normal, or close to it. In the meantime, though hiring is coming back, it\u2019s not back to normal quite yet. During this liminal period, you can\u2019t approach your job search the same way you did during the boom.\n\nAs such, even though this was a very long post, the main takeaways are surprisingly short: It\u2019s more important than ever to have to get creative with how you get in the door (so you don\u2019t get lost in the shuffle), to be even more prepared for interviews than before (especially system design), and to do your best to get multiple offers (if you don\u2019t, it will be much harder to negotiate. Here are some specific resources and tips to help you do these things:\n\n- If you\u2019re targeting specific companies but don\u2019t have connections there, don\u2019t apply online and don\u2019t wait. Instead, reach out to hiring managers directly. And don\u2019t do it on LinkedIn; email is a much better channel.\n- Use our [Company Intros](https://start.interviewing.io/company-introductions) feature if you have access \u2014 we get you in front of a decision-maker human immediately.\n- Use our [company process guides](https://interviewing.io/topics#companies) to help you plan your job searches and to prepare for specific companies. And use our [Learning Center](https://interviewing.io/learn) too. It has technical topic explanations, a bunch of interview replays, and a whole lot more.\n- Prepare for your interviews. You don\u2019t have to use us. Just find a way to do some mock interviews before your real ones.\n  - Our [AI Interviewer](https://start.interviewing.io/interview-ai) is a great, free resource that\u2019s more effective than LeetCoding on your own \u2014 it lets you practice algorithmic questions with a human-like interviewer in CoderPad and gives you feedback at the end.\n  - If you don\u2019t have an interviewing.io account, you can also try out our [Technical Interviewer custom GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-Fhk16eFON-technical-interviewer-by-interviewing-io) (it does system design interviews as well!).\n- Study system design (we have the [best system design guide that\u2019s out there](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)). Lackluster performance in system design interviews is the main reason people are getting down-leveled.\n- In this climate, negotiating is harder. Don\u2019t set yourself up to fail.

In some ways, I\u2019m the meritocracy hipster who was [writing about how eng hiring should be meritocratic](https://blog.alinelerner.com/silicon-valley-hiring-is-not-a-meritocracy/) and about [how quotas are bad](https://blog.alinelerner.com/diversity-quotas-suck-heres-why/), way before saying either was cool. At interviewing.io, my team and I have been trying to make hiring meritocratic for the last decade. Briefly, we do anonymous mock interviews. If people perform well in those interviews, they get introduced directly to decision-makers at top-tier companies, regardless of how they look on paper. 40% of the thousands of people we\u2019ve helped were excellent engineers who did not look good on paper and would NOT have gotten in the door through traditional, \u201cmeritocratic\u201d channels. Many of those engineers were rejected based on their resumes by the very same companies where they were later hired through us.\n\nRecently, there\u2019s been a lot of pro-meritocracy, anti-DEI rhetoric. The most salient example is [Alexandr Wang\u2019s (CEO of Scale AI) tweet about how their hiring process has to be meritocratic](https://twitter.com/alexandr_wang/status/1801331034916851995) (including a catchy new acronym, \u201cMEI\u201d).\n\n> Today we\u2019ve formalized an important hiring policy at Scale. We hire for MEI: merit, excellence, and intelligence.  \n>   \n> This is the email I\u2019ve shared with our [@scale\\_AI](https://twitter.com/scale_AI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) team.  \n>   \n> \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  \n>   \n> MERITOCRACY AT SCALE  \n>   \n> In the wake of our fundraise, I\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions\u2026\n>\n> \u2014 Alexandr Wang (@alexandr\\_wang) [June 13, 2024](https://twitter.com/alexandr_wang/status/1801331034916851995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThe post got a resounding \u201cGreat!\u201d from Elon Musk a half hour later, followed by a wall of accolades from the Twitterverse. Since then, a [\u201cmeritocracy board\u201d](https://www.meritocracy.com/) has sprung up as well.\n\nIf you read Wang\u2019s post carefully, you\u2019ll see that he provides no specific examples of how Scale AI makes hiring meritocratic and doesn\u2019t share any details about their current hiring process. I don\u2019t know anyone from the Scale AI team personally, but after doing eng hiring in some form or another for over 15 years, I have questions. Does Scale AI\u2019s hiring process differ substantially from other companies\u2019? Or are they doing the same thing as everyone else: recruiters look at resumes, pick people who have top brands on their resume, and interview them?\n\n**If their process is indeed like everyone else\u2019s, no matter what they say, they\u2019re no more meritocratic than the companies who tout DEI hiring practices\u2026 and are just virtue signaling on Twitter.**\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that DEI is ideologically flawed because of its emphasis on race and gender-based outcomes and its insistence on equality of those outcomes. In the last decade, we\u2019ve seen some pretty bad DEI practices, the most egregious being a company looking up candidate photos on LinkedIn and rejecting qualified white, male candidates. (I talk more about the worst-offending hiring practices I\u2019ve seen over the last decade in the section called *The dark side of diversity\u2026 and two stories of diversity initiatives gone wrong* below. If you just want the juicy bits, read that part.)\n\n**However, yelling \u201cMeritocracy!\u201d as if it\u2019s a fait accompli is just as harmful as the worst parts of DEI.** In the last decade, we\u2019ve seen countless companies claim to be meritocratic but refuse to talk to candidates unless they had a CS degree from one of a select few schools. There is nothing meritocratic about that. After seeing the pendulum swing back and forth a bunch in this space, **I\u2019d even go so far to say that, ironically, the DEI movement has done more for meritocracy than the loud pro-meritocracy movement is doing right now**.\n\n**I\u2019m delighted that \u201cmeritocracy\u201d is no longer a dirty word. But, just saying it isn\u2019t enough. We have to change our hiring practices.** We need to stop using meritocracy as a shield to preserve the status quo. **If we could instead put into practice the best part of DEI \u2013 openness to hiring candidates from non-traditional backgrounds while eliminating the toxic hyperfocus on race and gender and the insistence on equality of outcomes, then we could create a real meritocracy, which is what most reasonable people actually want.**[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n\n*A quick disclaimer before we go further. To the right, DEI has come to mean mediocrity, and as such, it\u2019s pitted, apples to apples, against meritocracy. That is not the intent here. When I talk about DEI, I\u2019m not talking about the political side of it or how it\u2019s often co-opted by the left as a gateway to Marxism. Similarly, meritocracy has been co-opted by the right to justify racism, eugenics, and god knows what other horrid things. Both extremes are bad. I\u2019m trying to shed all political associations from either word and to just talk about them purely as hiring ideologies.*\n\n## DEI\u2019s outcomes problem\n\nOn its face, increasing diversity sounds great. Some groups are underrepresented in tech, likely because of inequality of opportunity. Talent is distributed uniformly, opportunity is not. Let\u2019s fix it!\n\nTwitter threads like this one (from an engineering leader at Google) are hard to argue with. You should read the whole thing \u2014 it\u2019s about a (white) lumberjack\u2019s son who ended up as one of the founding employees at SpaceX.\n\n> Everyone loves SpaceX, and thinks of Elon as the genius founder that invents new types of rockets that are cheaper, faster, more efficient.  \n>   \n> It's fun to think of it as SpaceX versus NASA, or Silicon Valley vs Aerospace.  \n>   \n> But let's talk about D&I, and logs. Logs as in timber. \ud83c\udf32\n>\n> \u2014 Mekka \ud83d\udc89x7 @mekkaokereke@hachyderm.io (@mekkaokerekebye) [January 5, 2019](https://twitter.com/mekkaokerekebye/status/1081619342377156608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nAnd indeed, ostensibly, DEI is hard to argue against because it speaks to our innate desire for fairness and equal access to opportunity. Many DEI leaders honestly believe this. However, despite the good intentions, in practice, DEI tends to laser focus on race and gender *outcomes*, and that is hard to argue *for*.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve seen claims that diverse teams perform better, as well as claims that one must have a diverse workforce if one has a diverse customer base. Though it\u2019s often stated as fact, the former is inconclusive \u2014 there are studies with clear results for AND clear results against.[2](#user-content-fn-2) To the best of my knowledge, the latter point is unsubstantiated as well \u2014 isn\u2019t the hallmark of a good designer that they be able to design for customers who are different than they are?[3](#user-content-fn-3)\n\nThe arguments for diversity are inconclusive, and as such, the ultimate measure of success for diversity isn\u2019t about the performance of an organization or about customer satisfaction. Those are packaged up as obvious side benefits. The way we measure success for diversity is tautological: success is measured by the diversity of our workforce.\n\nWhat does that mean? **In practice, recruiting orgs usually define success by looking at some demographic and its representation in the general population.** So, in the case of women in tech, women make up half the U.S. population, so 50% of engineers in an organization should be women. Similarly, 12% of the U.S. population is Black, so for hiring to be equitable, 12% of the engineers in an organization should be Black. Likewise, 19% of the U.S. population is Hispanic, so 19% of engineers should be Hispanic, and so on.\n\nWhat\u2019s the problem with this approach? It does not account for inputs. The most basic input is: How many female engineers are there in the US? And how many Black or Hispanic engineers are there in the US?\n\nThe answer: not enough. Only 20% of CS graduates in the US are women. And there are also not enough engineers of color to get to race parity either. Only 6% of CS graduates in the US are Black, and only 7% are Hispanic.[4](#user-content-fn-4)\n\nThose numbers get even more grim when you pare them down to how companies usually hire: from top-ranked schools. We\u2019ll talk more about this pedigree-based approach to hiring when we discuss the pitfalls of meritocracy. For now, suffice it to say that a few years ago, [we ran the numbers to show that getting to gender parity in software engineering is mathematically impossible](https://interviewing.io/blog/we-ran-the-numbers-and-there-really-is-a-pipeline-problem-in-eng-hiring) given companies\u2019 focus on pedigree; though it was unfashionable to admit it, we called out that there really is a pipeline problem.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this issue: What portion of those candidates are even applying to your company in the first place? And what portion of those applicants are actually qualified to do the work? The ONLY way to really take race and gender bias off the table is to do blind as much of the hiring process as possible and then to accept that you may not get the numbers you want but that your outcomes will *actually* be fair.\n\n## The dark side of diversity (and two stories of diversity initiatives gone wrong)\n\nIn addition to mock interviews, interviewing.io also helps companies source engineering candidates. We know how people perform in mock interviews, and that lets us reliably predict who\u2019ll do well in real interviews. We identify the top performers from practice and introduce them to companies. We\u2019ve been doing it for a while, and our top performers have consistently outperformed candidates from other sources by about 3X.\n\n**I promised in the beginning of this post that I\u2019d spill some juicy tidbits. Here goes.**\n\nYears ago, we pitched Facebook\u2019s university recruiting team on using us to hire for their intern class. The pitch was that [we had thousands of college students from all over the U.S.](https://interviewing.io/blog/if-you-care-about-diversity-you-should-stop-hiring-from-the-same-five-schools) who had done a bunch of mock interviews, and that we knew who the top performers were. Many of our students did NOT come from the handful of top-tier schools that Meta typically recruited from. If they were to recruit through us, they\u2019d have to do way fewer interviews (we had already taken care of technical vetting), and they\u2019d get a much more diverse slice of the population.\n\nOur only process request was that they conduct interviews with students anonymously, on our platform, so they wouldn\u2019t be biased against top-performing students who didn\u2019t go to top schools.\n\n**We didn\u2019t get the gig. The main bit of pushback from Facebook was that anonymity violated guidelines set by the OFCCP.** The [OFCCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Federal_Contract_Compliance_Programs) (Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs) is part of the U.S. Department of Labor and is \u201cresponsible for ensuring that employers doing business with the Federal government comply with the laws and regulations requiring nondiscrimination.\u201d One of the many things that the OFCCP requires you to track, if you do business with the federal government, is the race and gender of your applicants. We couldn\u2019t agree to this. While the requirement makes sense on the surface \u2014 as they say, you can\u2019t fix what you can\u2019t measure \u2014 in this case, it was a Kafkaesque roadblock to achieving the very thing that the OFCCP is fighting for: reducing discrimination.[5](#user-content-fn-5)\n\nMore broadly, you can\u2019t take an outcomes-based approach unless your inputs are homogenous and the playing field is level. The biggest advocates of DEI will argue, correctly, that the playing field is not level. Given that it\u2019s not level, focusing exclusively on outcomes creates all manners of perverse incentives \u2014 the dark side of diversity is the logical conclusion of an outcomes-based approach: incentivizing the selection of candidates based on race and gender and ultimately discriminating against non-URM candidates.\n\nWe\u2019ve worked with companies of all sizes, from seed stage startups to FAANG, and at one point or another, we\u2019ve worked with most FAANGs and FAANG-adjacent companies. We\u2019ve seen it all. In 2022, at the height of diversity fever, one well-known FAANG-adjacent customer approached us with a specific request. Let\u2019s call them AcmeCorp (name obviously changed; they\u2019re a household name, but I don\u2019t want to rake them over the coals publicly because they were a great partner to us until this thing happened).\n\n**AcmeCorp\u2019s recruiting team wanted us to do some pre-filtering on the candidates we introduced to them.**\n\nWe already do some pre-filtering: location, years of experience, visa status, and obviously historical performance in mock interviews. Only the top few percent of our candidates get to talk to employers.\n\nBut on our platform, everything is candidate driven. We don\u2019t have a searchable candidate database, and we don\u2019t share candidate data with companies. Rather, we list the companies who hire through us, and our top-performing users can connect with them.\n\nOver our lifetime, plenty of companies have approached us asking if they could get access to *just* top-performing women and people of color on our platform. It makes sense. Recruiters are given marching orders to find more \u201cdiverse\u201d candidates, and this is the result. And it\u2019s a convenient way to pass on liability. Now, instead of their sourcers having to filter out candidates who aren\u2019t \u201cdiverse\u201d, we have to do it.\n\nOf course, we\u2019ve always denied these requests. We\u2019re not a \u201cdiversity\u201d platform, and we can\u2019t imagine a world where we\u2019d block what jobs and employers our users could see based on their race and gender (information we don\u2019t collect systematically in the first place).[6](#user-content-fn-6)\n\nEven though, on their face, these requests weren\u2019t really OK, we got so many of them that, over time, we got desensitized and would joke internally about how yet another company wanted a [binder full of women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binders_full_of_women).\n\nHowever, AcmeCorp\u2019s request was more egregious than the rest because it gave us visibility into how many companies were behaving internally when faced with diversity goals. It was common knowledge that many companies were doing diversity-specific sourcing, so we weren\u2019t shocked when we were asked to help with that. What wasn\u2019t common knowledge is that companies were blatantly rejecting qualified applicants who didn\u2019t meet their diversity criteria.\n\nAcmeCorp had a fairly complex candidate filtering process in place, and they wanted us to run that same process on any of our top performers who expressed interest in working there.\n\nHere\u2019s how their process worked. Note that AcmeCorp, like many companies, pays differently depending on where you live.\n\n- List a remote job that\u2019s hiring all over the United States.\n- When candidates apply from high cost of living areas (e.g., the SF Bay Area, NYC), only consider women and people of color. Reject the rest.\n- When candidates apply from lower cost of living areas (e.g., small towns in the Midwest), consider everyone.\n\n**In other words, a white man from San Francisco would have no shot at getting an interview at this company \u2014 he would be auto-rejected and left to wonder what was wrong with his resume.**\n\nWhy did this company take this approach? They were willing to pay top dollar for women and people of color but not for other types of engineers, and they hid behind geography to do it. Because of the geographical element, it\u2019s not as blatant as outright rejecting people based on race and gender, but for all intents and purposes, it\u2019s the same.\n\nOutside of this practice being questionably legal at best, it\u2019s also unethical. You can argue that companies should be able to do outreach to any demographic groups that they want. It\u2019s much harder to argue that it\u2019s ok to reject applicants based on their race and gender.\n\nWe terminated the relationship.[7](#user-content-fn-7)\n\nUnfortunately, when you tie the success of your recruiting program to gender and race outcomes, these are the behaviors that inevitably arise. For all its flaws, though, the DEI movement, coupled with increasing demand for engineers, propelled companies to make deep changes to their hiring processes. For every DEI horror story, there is an equal and opposing story about a Head of Talent or investor engineering leader who persuaded their eng hiring managers to stop looking just at students from MIT and Stanford, to change their interview processes, to blind resumes, and to do a bunch of other useful things that benefitted every non-traditional candidate.\n\nBut, back to what\u2019s happening today. You don\u2019t just get to say \u201cmeritocracy\u201d and be done with it. In practice, meritocratic hiring doesn\u2019t really exist, and what companies call meritocracy is anything but.\n\n## The false promise of meritocracy\n\nFor most sane people, the concept of meritocracy is hard to argue against. Shouldn\u2019t the most qualified person get the job?\n\n**Unfortunately, because the definition of \u201cqualified\u201d is murky, meritocracy often becomes a justification for over-indexing on pedigree: where people went to school or where they worked previously.** \u201cWe just hire the best\u201d often means \u201cwe hire people from FAANG, MIT, and Stanford.\u201d Unfortunately, those are proxies for ability, not actual measures of it. Our research has consistently shown that where people go to school isn\u2019t very predictive of what they can do. Where they\u2019ve worked is *somewhat* predictive, but it\u2019s not the most important thing.[8](#user-content-fn-8)\n\nDespite that, those are the main criteria that companies use when they decide whom to interview, and because that\u2019s the first step in a hiring funnel, it\u2019s the one that gets applied to the most candidates. Any attempts at making the process meritocratic after the resume review (e.g., training interviewers, doing anonymous interviews) are bound to be less impactful because they affect 10X-100X fewer candidates.\n\nFortunately, for all their flaws, at least technical interviews do focus on ability \u2014 once you get in the door, it\u2019s not about how you look on paper but about how you perform. As a result, all other things being equal, how you decide which candidates to let into your process is the litmus test for whether your process is truly meritocratic or not.\n\nUnfortunately, the pedigree-based approach isn\u2019t particularly meritocratic. In our 9 years, we\u2019ve diligently tracked the backgrounds of our candidates, and as I mentioned in the intro to this post, about 40% of our top performers don\u2019t look good on paper (but do as well as or outperform their pedigreed counterparts in interviews).\n\nOne of our users got rejected from a top-tier social network company three times\u2026 THREE TIMES\u2026 based on his resume before he got hired there through us, after doing very well in an anonymous interview. I\u2019ve shared a few diversity horror stories, but the sad reality is that (faux) meritocracy horror stories like this one happen every day. I wish I had a real meritocracy horror story to share, but as far as I know, eng hiring has never been truly meritocratic. If you know otherwise, please do share.\n\nOur data also shows that pedigree has very little bearing on interview performance. Where people went to school has no bearing on their interview performance, and though where people have worked does carry some signal, it\u2019s not nearly as important as other traits \u2014 in past research, we\u2019ve found that not having typos/grammatical errors on your resume is a much stronger signal than whether they\u2019ve worked at a top company, as is whether they\u2019ve done a lot of autodidactic work.[8](#user-content-fn-8)\n\nMoreover, in two separate studies completed a decade apart, where recruiters had to judge resumes and try to pick out the strong candidates, we consistently saw that recruiters are only as accurate as a coin flip and largely disagree with each other about what a good candidate looks like.[9](#user-content-fn-9)\n\n**That\u2019s why posts like the one from Scale AI get my hackles up. You don\u2019t get to say that you\u2019re meritocratic if you\u2019re just scanning resumes for top brands. That\u2019s not meritocracy. It\u2019s co-opting a hot-button word for clout.**\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Scale AI. This is how tech companies define being meritocratic and hiring the best. It\u2019s just that not all of them are so self-congratulatory about it.\n\nSo how do you ensure that your hiring is *actually* meritocratic?\n\n## How to actually \u201cdo\u201d meritocracy, if you mean it\n\nIn a [recent study](https://interviewing.io/blog/are-recruiters-better-than-a-coin-flip-at-judging-resumes), we looked at how recruiters read resumes and how good they are at finding talent. As you saw above, we learned that recruiters are barely better than a coin flip. Another thing we looked at in the same study was what made them pick certain resumes over others.\n\n**The two traits that were the most predictive of whether a recruiter would pick you? First, whether you had top brands on your resume, and second, whether you were Black or Hispanic. This is how recruiters work today. If you don\u2019t intervene and make changes, today\u2019s competing approaches will *both* be implemented by your team simultaneously, resulting in a farcical chimera of fake meritocracy and outcomes-based diversity goals.**\n\nSo what can you actually do, if you, in good faith, want to run a meritocratic hiring process? (By the way, if you believe that talent is distributed uniformly, by definition, this approach will entail being open to talent from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds.)\n\n**First, you have to move away from identity politics and expand the definition of \u201cunderrepresented.\u201d** You have to believe, in your heart of hearts, that great talent can come from anywhere and must stop focusing arbitrarily on one marginalized group at the expense of another. Basically, you have to be open to any candidate who\u2019s good, regardless of how they look on paper, without prioritizing race and gender. This certainly includes race and gender, but it also includes socioeconomic status, educational background (or lack thereof), and any number of other traits that have nothing to do with someone\u2019s ability to do the job. Hell, why not just stop worrying about candidate backgrounds and have a process that welcomes all and surfaces the best? Following this path will logically require moving away from race and gender outcomes-based goals.\n\n**Then, you have to accept and internalize that your current method of deciding who gets to interview, which is very likely focused on brands (where people have worked or where they\u2019ve gone to school), is not only NOT meritocratic but also ineffective.** We talked above about how pedigree is very limited in its ability to predict performance.\n\n**If you accept both of these premises \u2014 expanding the definition of \u201cunderrepresented\u201d and moving away from focusing on brands \u2014 the hard work begins.** Companies have used resumes (and brands by extension) since time immemorial because they\u2019re easy, and as you saw in our data above, they do carry *some* signal. But even though they carry a little signal, recruiters are not very good at extracting it.\n\n**Here\u2019s what you should do to pragmatically and realistically revamp your hiring process to be more meritocratic.** I challenge Scale AI and all the leaders on the \u201cmeritocracy board\u201d to publicly commit to at least two of these \u2014 or to name the specific, actionable approaches they plan to take.\n\n- Change how you read resumes.[10](#user-content-fn-10)\n- Give candidates the option of submitting some writing about a past project they\u2019re proud of.\n- Give candidates the option of doing a take-home or an asynchronous assessment. Put enough work into those assignments such that you\u2019ll trust their outcome enough to not have to look at a resume.\n- [EXTRA CREDIT] Invest what you can in closing the gaps.\n\n### Change how you read resumes\n\nFirst, SLOW DOWN. In [the study I mentioned above](https://interviewing.io/blog/are-recruiters-better-than-a-coin-flip-at-judging-resumes), we saw that recruiters take a median of 31 seconds to judge a resume, but spending just 15 extra seconds reading a resume could improve your accuracy by 34%.\n\nOur second piece of advice is this. More than 20 years ago, Freada Kapor Klein from Kapor Capital coined the term \u201cdistance traveled,\u201d referring to what someone accomplished, in the context of where they started. For instance, Kapor Klein recommends that, in their admissions processes, universities should consider not just the number of AP tests a candidate has passed but the number of AP tests taken divided by the total number offered at their high school. For example, if an applicant took 5 AP tests and their school offered 27, that paints a very different picture from another applicant who also took 5 AP tests when that\u2019s the total number offered at their school. Kapor Capital uses distance traveled as one of their metrics for determining which entrepreneurs to fund. One can easily apply this concept to hiring as well.\n\nThe data shows that slowing down is important, and as part of slowing down, when you read a resume, try to evaluate candidates\u2019 achievements, not in a vacuum, but in the context of where they came from. Think about the denominator. But don\u2019t think for a moment that we recommend that you lower the bar \u2014 absolutely not. On interviewing.io, we regularly see nontraditional candidates objectively outperforming their FAANG counterparts.\n\n### Give candidates the option of submitting some writing about a past project they\u2019re proud of\n\nMy friends at KeepSafe and I [ran an experiment about a decade ago where we tried replacing resumes with a writing sample about a past project](https://blog.alinelerner.com/what-happens-when-you-stop-relying-on-resumes/). It was a huge success.\n\nEven today, when we hire at interviewing.io, we use this approach. We mostly hire off of our own platform (we just list our own open positions alongside others). However, not all of our users have done enough mock interviews to have a rating, and for those users, we have a different flow where we ask them to write about a past project. Boy, are the results telling.\n\nHere\u2019s what our application form looks like. Steal it if you want.\n\n![typeform application paragraph about project](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/typeform_application_paragraph_about_project_8777b4bcfc.png)\n  \n\n### Give candidates the option of doing a take-home or an asynchronous assessment\n\nTake-homes and asynchronous assessments are not well-loved by candidates, primarily because of value asymmetry. They ask a lot of the candidate but nothing of the company, and it\u2019s not uncommon for a candidate to have to do hours of work and then never hear anything back.\n\nTo be clear, this is NOT the setup we\u2019re advocating. Here\u2019s what we\u2019d advise instead:\n\nGive candidates the option of doing a take-home/assessment that takes no more than 1 hour, *instead of submitting their resume*. When we say option, we mean that the candidate can decide whether they want to do the take-home or not. If they choose not to, then you\u2019ll read their resume, hopefully using our suggestions above. If they choose to complete the take-home, then you forgo their resume and make your go/no-go decision based entirely on the results of the take-home.\n\nIf you choose this route, it\u2019s critical to [come up with an assessment whose results you trust](https://interviewing.io/blog/why-engineers-dont-like-take-homes-and-how-companies-can-fix-them). Many companies use a take-home in addition to getting the resume and will still not move forward with candidates who look good on paper. That\u2019s not meritocratic. Take the time you need to come up with a question that\u2019s hard to cheat on and that gets you the signal you need. Yes, coming up with a good assessment takes work. But no one said that making your hiring process meritocratic was easy.\n\n### [EXTRA CREDIT] Invest what you can in closing the gaps\n\nThis advice probably applies more to big companies than smaller ones, because bigger ones have more resources to effect change. Regardless, if you believe in meritocracy, then you understand that a true meritocracy is not possible without a level playing field for your candidates. One of the best things about the DEI movement is that it\u2019s made us aware how unlevel the playing field really is. Whether you subscribe to DEI or not, this is probably not a controversial statement, and if you want to see true, meritocratic hiring, you have some obligation to help promote equality of *opportunity*.\n\nWhere to begin?\n\nAlthough I expect that it\u2019s not level in many places, and there are plenty of opportunities to effect change, starting with elementary education[11](#user-content-fn-11), I'll talk about the inequality I\u2019ve observed firsthand repeatedly over the last decade: [the technical interview practice gap](https://interviewing.io/blog/technical-interview-practice-gap). How much you practice is the biggest predictive factor of interview performance \u2014 not seniority, not gender, and not a CS degree. And so is socialization. After all, if you\u2019re around people going through the same thing, like at a top-tier CS school, rather than beating yourself up after a disappointing interview, you\u2019ll start to internalize that technical interviewing is flawed and that the outcomes are sometimes unpredictable. Fortunately, there are interventions one can make to close these gaps, and the simplest is to provide practice and community for people who don\u2019t have access to them. Reach out to us about this, find a non-profit that helps people practice, donate to your favorite university if they have a good practice program, or any number of other things.\n\nUltimately, which gap you choose to help close and how you choose to do it is up to you. But if your company has the means, it\u2019s your responsibility to invest in gap-closing measures. You don\u2019t have to donate money. You can offer mock interviews to your candidates before their real interviews. You can start an apprenticeship program. You can encourage your engineers to do some tutoring. However you approach it, though, you can\u2019t talk about meritocracy with a straight face and not do *something* to level the playing field.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. In fairness, the Scale AI post positioned them as symbiotic. I believe that as well. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n2. There are many sources arguing for and against diversity leading to better-performing teams. Here are some examples:\n     \n   For: <https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters>  \n   Against: <https://medium.com/the-liberators/in-depth-the-double-edged-sword-of-diversity-in-teams-765ff72a55da> (except for \u201cage diversity\u201d) and <https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2021/05/25/diversity-and-performance-in-entrepreneurial-teams/> [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-2)\n3. One of the most insulting examples of the \u201cwe need a diverse workforce to serve our diverse customer base\u201d argument occurred when I was pitching Amazon on using interviewing.io to hire. This was years ago, and back then, out of curiosity, I\u2019d always ask the organizations we were pitching why they valued diversity. I don\u2019t think I ever got a good answer, but this one was especially bad. One of the recruiters we met with went on a long diatribe about how Amazon sells lots of shoes and you need women on the eng team because women understand shoes better than men. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-3)\n4. Getting more women and people of color to study computer science is a worthy cause. Hell, getting anyone who\u2019s historically been marginalized to study computer science is worthwhile. It\u2019s great for our economy, and it\u2019s currently one of the best levers for upward social mobility available. But, while we hope more companies do these things, it is not reasonable to expect that companies can be responsible for educational interventions that often need to start at the elementary school level. Of course, companies should do what they can. But expecting them to pull off mathematical impossibilities is irrational, and the DEI movement\u2019s stalwart refusal to acknowledge the pipeline problem undermines the movement as a whole. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-4)\n5. I was actually able to get in touch with a former OFCCP higher-up who admitted that rejecting anonymity in hiring was against the spirit of OFCCP requirements. But they sadly wouldn\u2019t go on the record. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-5)\n6. The closest we\u2019ve ever come to doing this is our Fellowship program, where we gave free practice to engineers from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds. It was a great program, but what made it great was that our interviewers were eager to help these candidates. We were able to do free practice because our interviewers graciously agreed not to charge. That said, if I were to run this program again, I\u2019d probably focus more on socioeconomic status and non-traditional credentials rather than just race and gender. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-6)\n7. Here\u2019s the email we ended the relationship with. I\u2019m including it because it was hard to write and even harder to hit send on, but I think we did the right thing, and maybe someone else will need to write something like this in the future\u2026 in which case, please steal our copy. ![interviewing.io termination letter to partner related to dei](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Termination_letter_ef5d2c81ed.png) [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-7)\n8.

Anyone who\u2019s read my writing for a long time will pause here and wonder why I\u2019m OK with resumes and recommending anything about reading them. Until recently, I was stalwartly against resumes and convinced that they carried no signal whatsoever. Then, as part of [the recruiter study I mentioned](https://interviewing.io/blog/are-recruiters-better-than-a-coin-flip-at-judging-resumes), we built some simple ML models to judge resumes and compared their performance to human recruiters. They all outperformed recruiters, and that surprising result made me reverse my stance. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-9)\n10.

We ran an experiment.\n\nBy Mike Mroczka | Published: January 30, 2024; Last updated: May 6, 2024\n\n*Edit: This article originally contained a TikTok video of someone cheating in an interview with ChatGPT. Videos like this still can be found online, but companies hate them, so they don't stay up for long*\n\nChatGPT has revolutionized work as we know it. From helping small businesses automate their administrative tasks to coding entire React components for web developers, its usefulness is hard to overstate.\n\nAt interviewing.io, we've been thinking a lot about how ChatGPT will change technical interviewing. **One big question is: Does ChatGPT make it easy to cheat in interviews?** You've probably started to hear concerns about students cheating on their homework with ChatGPT, and we are certain that some people have tried to cheat in interviews with it, too!\n\nInitial responses to cheating software have been pretty much in line with what you\u2019d expect:\n\n- Redditors state that \u201c[ChatGPT is the end of coding as we know it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/12zyela/chatgpt_spells_the_end_of_coding_as_we_know_it/)\u201d\n- YouTubers announce that \u201c[Software engineering is dead. ChatGPT killed it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeebS-VcSH0)\u201d\n- X (formerly Twitter) questions if \u201c[\u200b\u200bChatGPT spell(s) the end for Coding Interviews?](https://twitter.com/intx_podcast/status/1635396953109561344)\u201d\n\nIt seems clear that ChatGPT can assist people during their interviews, but we wanted to know:\n\n- How much can it help?\n- How easy is it to cheat (and get away with it)?\n- Will companies that ask LeetCode questions need to make significant changes to their interview process?\n\nTo answer these questions, we recruited some of our professional interviewers and users for a cheating experiment! Below, we\u2019ll share everything we discovered and explain what it means for you. As a little preview, just know this: companies need to change the types of interview questions they are asking\u2014immediately.\n\n## The experiment\n\ninterviewing.io is an interview practice platform and recruiting marketplace for engineers. Engineers use us for mock interviews. Companies use us to hire top performers. We have thousands of professional interviewers in our ecosystem, and hundreds of thousands of engineers have used our platform to prepare for interviews.[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n\n### Interviewers\n\nInterviewers came from our pool of professional interviewers. They were broken into three groups, with each group asking a different type of question. **The interviewers had no idea that the experiment was about ChatGPT or cheating; we told them that \"[this] research study aims to understand the trends in the predictability of an interviewer\u2019s decisions over time \u2013 especially when asking standard vs. non-standard interview questions.\"**\n\nThese were the three question types:\n\n1. **Verbatim LeetCode questions**: questions pulled directly from LeetCode at the interviewer's discretion with no modifications to the question.\n\nExample: The [Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/) LeetCode question is asked exactly as it is written.\n\n2. **Modified LeetCode questions**: questions pulled from LeetCode and then modified to be similar to the original but still notably different from it.\n\nExample: The [Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/) question above but modified to have four integers (0,1,2,3) instead of just three integers (0,1,2) in the input.\n\n3. **Custom questions**: questions that aren\u2019t directly tied to any question that exists online.\n\nExample: You are given a log file with the following format:\n- `<username>: <text> - <contribution score>`\n- Your task is to identify the user who represents the median level of engagement in a conversation. Only consider users with a contribution score greater than 50%. Assume that the number of such users is odd, and you need to find the one right in the middle when sorted by their contribution scores. Given the file below, the correct answer is SyntaxSorcerer.\n\n```\nLOG FILE START\nNullPointerNinja: \"who's going to the event tomorrow night?\" - 100%\nLambdaLancer: \"wat?\" - 5%\nNullPointerNinja: \"the event which is on 123 avenue!\" - 100%\nSyntaxSorcerer: \"I'm coming! I'll bring chips!\" - 80%\nSyntaxSorcerer: \"and something to drink!\" - 80%\nLambdaLancer: \"I can't make it\" - 25%\nLambdaLancer: \"\ud83d\ude41\" - 25%\nLambdaLancer: \"I really wanted to come too!\" - 25%\nBitwiseBard: \"I'll be there!\" - 25%\nCodeMystic: \"me too and I'll brink some dip\" - 75%\nLOG FILE END\n\n```\n\nFor more information about question types and about how we designed this experiment, please read the [Interviewer Experiment Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1UdWZHUQfeLR8oUiNY4JfwgES42HTlAQL5z_VfQJPPKk/edit) doc that we shared with participating interviewers.\n\n### Interviewees\n\nInterviewees came from our pool of active users and were invited to participate in a short survey. We selected interviewees who:\n\n- Were actively looking for a job in today's market\n- Had 4+ years of experience and were applying to senior-level positions\n- Rated their \u201cChatGPT while coding\u201d familiarity as moderate to high\n- Identified themselves as someone who thought they could cheat in an interview without getting caught\n\nThis selection helped us skew the candidates toward people who could feasibly cheat in an interview, had the motivation to do so, and were already reasonably familiar with ChatGPT and coding interviews.\n\n**We told interviewees that they had to use ChatGPT in the interview, and the goal was to test their ability to cheat with ChatGPT.** They were also told not to try to pass the interview with their own skills \u2014 the point was to rely on ChatGPT.\n\nWe ended up conducting 37 interviews overall, 32 of which we were able to use (we had to remove 5 because participants didn\u2019t follow directions):\n\n- 11 with the \u201cverbatim\u201d treatment\n- 9 with the \u201cmodified\u201d treatment\n- 12 with the \u201ccustom\u201d treatment\n\nA quick disclaimer. Because our platform allows for anonymity, our interviews have audio but no video. We\u2019re anonymous because we want to create a safe space for our users to fail and learn quickly without judgment. It\u2019s great for our users, but we acknowledge that not having video in these interviews makes our experiment less realistic. In a real interview, you will be on camera with a job on the line, which makes cheating harder \u2014 but does not eliminate it.\n\nAfter the interviews, both interviewers and interviewees had to complete an exit survey. We asked interviewees about the difficulties of using ChatGPT during the interview, and interviewers were given multiple chances to express concerns about the interview \u2014 we wanted to see how many interviewers would flag their interviews as problematic and report that they suspected cheating.\n\n![Post-survey interviewee questions](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FInterviewee_Collage_Survey_88a5b0a095.jpg&w=1200&q=75 \"Post-survey interviewee questions\")\n\nPost-survey interviewee questions\n\n\n\n![Post-survey interviewer questions](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FInterviewer_Collage_Survey_a0e0cf80fb.jpg&w=1200&q=75 \"Post-survey interviewer questions\")\n\nPost-survey interviewer questions\n\nWe had no idea what would happen in this experiment, but we assumed that if half the candidates that cheated got away with it and passed the interview, it would be a telling result for our industry.\n\n## Results\n\nAfter removing interviews where participants did not follow instructions[2](#user-content-fn-2), we got the following results. Our control was how candidates performed in interviewing.io mock interviews outside the study: 53%.[3](#user-content-fn-3) Note that most mock interviews on our platform are LeetCode-style questions, which makes sense because that's primarily what FAANG companies ask. We'll come back to this in a moment.\n\n![Pass Rate by Question Type with the Control group at 53%, the Verbatim group at 73%, the Modified group at 67%, and the Custom group at 25%](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FPass_rate_by_question_type_when_trying_to_cheat_with_Chat_GPT_c20c87712e.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Pass Rate by Question Type with the Control group at 53%, the Verbatim group at 73%, the Modified group at 67%, and the Custom group at 25%\")\n\n'Verbatim' questions passed significantly more often, compared to both our platform average and to 'custom' questions. 'Verbatim' and 'modified' questions were not statistically significantly differnt from each other. 'Custom' questions had a significantly lower pass rate than any of the other groups.\n\n### \u201cVerbatim\u201d questions\n\nPredictably, the verbatim group performed the best, passing 73% of their interviews. Interviewees reported that they got the perfect solution from ChatGPT.\n\nThe most notable comment from the post-interview survey for this group is below \u2014 we think it is particularly telling of what was going on in many of the interviewers\u2019 minds:\n\n> *\u201cIt's tough to determine if the candidate breezed through the question because they're actually good or if they've heard this question before. Normally, I add 1-2 unique twists to the problem to ascertain the difference.\u201d*\n\nNormally, this interviewer would have followed up with a modified question to get more signal, so let\u2019s examine the \u201cmodified\u201d group next to see if interviewers actually got more signal by adding a twist to their questions.\n\n### \u201cModified\u201d questions\n\nRemember, this group may have had a LeetCode question given to them, which was standard but modified in a way that was not directly available online. This means ChatGPT couldn\u2019t have had a direct answer to this question. Hence, the interviewees were much more dependent on ChatGPT's actual problem-solving abilities than its ability to regurgitate LeetCode tutorials.\n\nAs predicted, the results for this group weren\u2019t too different from the \u201cverbatim\u201d group, with 67% of candidates passing their interviews. As it turns out, this difference was not statistically significantly different from the \"verbatim\" group, i.e., \u201cmodified\u201d and \u201cverbatim\u201d are essentially the same. This result suggests that ChatGPT can handle minor modifications to questions without much trouble. Interviewees did notice, however, that it took more prompting to get ChatGPT to solve the modified questions. As one of our interviewees said:\n\n> *\u201cQuestions that are lifted directly from LeetCode were no problem at all. A follow-up question that was not so much directly LeetCode-style was much harder to get ChatGPT to answer.\u201d*\n\n### \u201cCustom\u201d questions\n\nAs expected, the \u201ccustom\u201d question group had the lowest pass rate, with only 25% of candidates passing. **Not only is it statistically significantly smaller than the other two treatment groups, it's significantly lower than the control! When you ask candidates fully custom questions, they perform worse than they do when they're not cheating (and getting asked LeetCode-style questions)!**\n\nNote that this number, when initially calculated, was marginally higher, but after reviewing the custom questions in detail, we discovered a problem with this question type we hadn\u2019t anticipated, which had skewed the results minorly toward a higher pass rate. Read the section below called \"Companies: Change the questions you are asking immediately!\" to find out what that problem was.\n\n## No one was caught cheating!\n\nIn our experiment, interviewers were not aware that the interviewees were being asked to cheat. As you recall, after each interview, we had interviewers complete a survey in which they had to describe how confident they were in their assessments of candidates.\n\n**Interviewer confidence in the correctness of their assessments was high, with 72% saying they were confident in their hiring decision.** One interviewer felt so strongly about an interviewee's performance that they concluded we should invite them to be an interviewer on the platform!\n\n> *\u201cThe candidate performed very well and demonstrated knowledge of a strong Amazon L6 (Google L5) SWE... and could also be considered to be an interviewer/mentor on interviewing.io.\u201d*\n\nThat is a lot of confidence after just one interview \u2014 probably too much!\n\nWe\u2019ve long known that [engineers are bad at gauging their own performance](https://interviewing.io/blog/own-interview-performance), so perhaps it shouldn\u2019t come as a shock to find that interviewers also overestimate the effectiveness of the questions that they ask.\n\nOf the interviewers who were not confident in their hiring choice (28%), we asked them why. This was the frequency distribution of their reasons.\n\n![Interviewers weren't confident in their assessment because the candidate gave suboptimal solutions, missed edge cases, had messy code, was inarticulate, or occasionally had other niche issues, but no interviewer was called out cheating as a concern](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FInterviewer_confidence_61b40b9ce1.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Note that cheating isn\u2019t mentioned anywhere!\")\n\nNote that cheating isn\u2019t mentioned anywhere!\n\nMost interviewers concerned about their hiring decision expressed specific reasons for their lack of confidence. These issues typically included suboptimal solutions, missed edge cases, messy code, or poor communication. We specifically included an \u201cOther Issue\u201d category to see if they would express a concern that the interviewee was cheating, but digging deeper revealed only minor grievances like \u201cpersonality issues\u201d and \u201cthey need to speed up their coding.\u201d\n\nIn addition to having this opportunity to call out cheating, interviewers were prompted three additional times to note any other concerns they had with the interview, including free-form text boxes and several multiple-choice questions with options to explain their concerns.\n\nWhen an interviewee bombed because they didn\u2019t understand the ChatGPT response, the interviewer chalked up the interviewee\u2019s odd behavior and stilted responses to a lack of practice \u2014 not cheating. One interviewer thought the candidate's problem-solving was fine but commented that they were slow and needed to consider edge cases more carefully.\n\n> *\u201cCandidate did not seem prepared for any LeetCode questions.\"*\n\n> *\u201cCandidate's approach lacked clarity, and they jumped into the coding too early.\u201d*\n\n> *\u201cThe candidate was not prepared to tackle even the most basic coding questions on LeetCode.\u201d*\n\n> *\u201cGood problem solving in general, but the candidate needs to be faster at coding and identifying critical edge cases.\u201d*\n\nSo, who reported concerns about cheating? And who got caught?\n\n**As it turns out, not a single interviewer mentioned concerns about any of the candidates cheating!**\n\nWe were stunned to discover that interviewers reported no suspicions of cheating, and interestingly, interviewees were largely confident that they were getting away with it, too. 81% reported no concerns about being caught, 13% thought they might have tipped off the interviewer, and an astonishingly small 6% of participants thought the interviewer suspected them of cheating.\n\n![81% of interviewees were not worried, 13% were slightly worried, and just 6% were very worried about being caught](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FInterviewee_worry_level_6d1445e631.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Interviewees were mostly sure that their cheating went undetected\")\n\nInterviewees were mostly sure that their cheating went undetected\n\nThe candidates who worried they were caught did have abnormal comments from the interviewers in the post-survey analysis, but they still were not suspected of cheating. **To summarize, most candidates thought they were getting away with cheating \u2014 and they were right!**\n\n## Companies: Change the questions you are asking immediately!\n\nThe obvious conclusion from these results is that **companies need to start asking custom questions immediately, or they are at serious risk of candidates cheating during interviews (and ultimately not getting useful signal from their interviews)!**\n\nChatGPT has made verbatim questions obsolete; anyone relying on them will be naively leaving their hiring processes up to chance. Hiring is [already tricky enough](https://interviewing.io/blog/we-ran-the-numbers-and-there-really-is-a-pipeline-problem-in-eng-hiring) without worrying about cheating. If you\u2019re part of a company that uses verbatim LeetCode questions, please share this post internally!\n\nUsing custom questions isn\u2019t just a good way to prevent cheating. It filters out candidates who have memorized a bunch of LeetCode solutions (as you saw, our custom question pass rate was significantly lower than our control). It also meaningfully improves candidate experience, which makes people way more likely to want to work for you. A while ago, we did an [analysis of what makes good interviewers good](https://interviewing.io/blog/best-technical-interviews-common). Not surprisingly, asking good questions was one of the hallmarks, and our best-rated interviewers were the ones who tended to ask custom questions! Question quality was extremely significant in our study, regarding whether the candidate wanted to move forward with the company. It was much more important than the company\u2019s brand strength, which mattered for getting candidates in the door but didn\u2019t matter relative to question quality once they were in process.\n\nAs some of our interviewees said\u2026\n\n> *\u201cAlways nice to get questions that are more than just plain algorithms.\u201d*\n\n> *\u201cI liked the question \u2014 it takes a relatively simple algorithms problem (build and traverse a tree) and adds some depth. I also liked that the interviewer connected the problem to a real product at [Redacted], which made it feel less like a toy problem and more like a pared-down version of a real problem.\u201d*\n\n> *\u201cThis is my favorite question that I\u2019ve encountered on this site. It was one of the only ones that seemed to have real-life applicability and was drawn from a real (or potentially real) business challenge. And it also nicely wove in challenges like complexity, efficiency, and blocking.\u201d*\n\nOne more somewhat subtle piece of advice for companies who decide to move to more custom questions. You might be tempted to take verbatim LeetCode questions and change up the wording or some of the window dressing. That makes sense, because it\u2019s certainly easier than coming up with questions from scratch. Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t work.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, we discovered in this experiment that just because a question looks like a custom question, doesn\u2019t mean it is one. Questions can appear custom and still be identical to an existing LeetCode question. **When making questions to ask candidates, it isn\u2019t enough to obscure an existing problem.** You need to ensure that the problem has unique inputs and outputs to be effective at stopping ChatGPT from recognizing it!\n\nThe questions that interviewers ask are confidential, and we cannot share the exact questions that our interviewers used in the experiment. However, we can give you an indicative example. Below is a \u201ccustom question\u201d with this critical flaw, which is easy for ChatGPT to beat:\n\n```\nFor her birthday, Mia received a mysterious box containing numbered cards \nand a note saying, \"Combine two cards that add up to 18 to unlock your gift!\" \nHelp Mia find the right pair of cards to reveal her surprise.\n\nInput: An array of integers (the numbers on the cards), and the target sum (18). \narr = [1, 3, 5, 10, 8], target = 18\n\nOutput: The indices of the two cards that add up to the target sum. \nIn this case, [3, 4] because index 3 and 4 add to 18 (10+8).\n\n```\n\nDid you spot the issue? While this question appears \u201ccustom\u201d at first glance, its objective is identical to the popular [TwoSum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) question: finding two numbers that sum to a given target. The inputs and outputs are identical; the only thing \u201ccustom\u201d about the question is the story added to the problem.\n\nSeeing that this is identical to known problems, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise to learn that ChatGPT does well on questions that have inputs and outputs identical to existing known problems \u2014 even when they have a unique story added to them.\n\n### How to actually create good custom questions\n\nOne thing we\u2019ve found incredibly useful for coming up with good, original questions is to start a shared doc with your team where every time someone solves a problem they think is interesting, no matter how small, they jot down a quick note. These notes don\u2019t have to be fleshed out at all, but they can be the seeds for unique interview questions that give candidates insight into the day-to-day at your company. Turning these disjointed seeds into interview questions takes thought and effort \u2014 you have to prune a lot of the details and distill the essence of the problem into something that doesn\u2019t take the candidate a lot of work/setup to grok. You\u2019ll also likely have to iterate on these home-grown questions a few times before you get them right \u2014 but the payoff can be huge.\n\nTo be clear, we\u2019re not advocating the removal of data structures and algorithms from technical interviews. DS&A questions have gotten a bad reputation because of bad, unengaged interviewers and because of companies lazily rehashing LeetCode problems, many of them bad, which have nothing to do with their work. In the hands of good interviewers, those questions are powerful and useful. If you use the approach above, you\u2019ll be able to come up with new data structure & algorithmic questions that have a practical foundation and component that will engage candidates and get them excited about the work you\u2019re doing.\n\nYou\u2019ll also be moving our industry forward. It\u2019s not OK that memorizing a bunch of LeetCode questions gives candidates an edge in today\u2019s interview process, nor is it OK that interviews have gotten to a state where cheating starts to look like a rational choice. The solution is more work on the employer\u2019s part to come up with better questions. Let\u2019s all do it together.\n\n## Real talk for job seekers\n\nAll right, now, for all of you who are actively looking for work, listen up! Yes, a subset of your peers will now be using ChatGPT to cheat in interviews, and at companies that ask LeetCode questions (sadly, many of them), those peers will have an edge\u2026 for a short while.\n\n**Right now, we\u2019re in a liminal state where companies\u2019 processes have not caught up to reality. They will, soon enough, either by moving away from using verbatim LeetCode questions entirely (which will be a boon for our entire industry) or by returning to in-person onsites (which will make cheating largely impossible past the technical screen) or both.**\n\nIt sucks that other candidates cheating is another thing to worry about in an [already difficult climate](https://interviewing.io/blog/you-now-need-to-do-15-percent-better-in-technical-interviews), but we cannot, in good conscience, endorse cheating to \u201clevel the playing field.\u201d\n\nIn addition, interviewees who used ChatGPT uniformly reported how much more difficult the interview was to complete while juggling the AI.\n\nBelow, you can view one interviewee stumbling through their time complexity analysis after giving a perfect answer to an interview question. The interviewer is confused as the interviewee scrambles to explain how they got to their incorrect time complexity (secretly provided by ChatGPT).\n\nWhile no one was caught during the study, their cameras were off, and cheating was still difficult for many of our skilled candidates, as evidenced by this clip.\n\nEthics aside, cheating is difficult, stressful, and not entirely straightforward to implement. Instead, we advise investing that effort into practice, which will serve you well once companies change their processes, which hopefully should be soon. Ultimately, we hope the advent of ChatGPT will be the catalyst that finally moves our industry\u2019s interview standards away from grinding and memorizing to actually testing engineering ability.\n\n![Author avatar](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F15_2024_03_08_Mroczka_Headshots_Ray_Glaser_Photography_DSC_3702_81cf562c2c.jpg&w=384&q=75 \"Mike Mroczka\")\n\nMike Mroczka\n\nMike Mroczka, a former senior SWE (Google, Salesforce, GE), is the primary author of [Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.beyondctci.com/)\u2014the official sequel to Gayle McDowell's original CTCI.

In two instances, the interviewee was familiar with the question and chose to solve the problem themselves.

We\u2019ve come to learn that interview practice matters just as much. The resume gets you in the door, and your interview performance is what gets you the offer. But, even though technical interviews are hard and scary for everyone \u2014 many of our users are senior engineers from FAANG who are terrified of getting back out there and code up the kinds of problems they don\u2019t usually see at work while someone breathes down their neck \u2014 interview prep isn\u2019t equitably distributed.\n\nThis inequity never really sat right with me (that\u2019s why interviewing.io exists), but when [we started charging for interview practice post-COVID](https://interviewing.io/blog/interviewing-io-is-out-of-beta-anonymous-technical-interview-practice-for-all), it *really* didn\u2019t sit right with me.\n\nAs you may have read, if you follow interviewing.io news, COVID-19 turned our world upside down. In its wake, the pandemic left a deluge of hiring slowdowns and freezes. For a recruiting marketplace, this was an existential worst nightmare \u2014 in a matter of weeks, we found ourselves down from 7-figure revenue to literally nothing. Companies didn\u2019t really want or need to pay for hiring anymore, and we were screwed.\n\nThen, we pivoted and started charging our users, who had previously been able to practice on our platform completely for free (albeit with some strings, more on that in a moment). While this pivot was the right thing to do \u2014 without it, we would have had to shut down the company, unable to provide any practice at all \u2014 charging people, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, didn\u2019t sit right with us, and in our last post announcing our model, we made the following promises:\n\n- We\u2019d ALWAYS have a free tier\n- **We\u2019d immediately start working on a fellowship for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds or in a visa crisis/experiencing financial hardship \u2190** *That\u2019s what this post is about!*\n- We\u2019d find a way to let people defer their payments\n\nWe launched with a free tier, and it\u2019s still there and going strong. We\u2019re still working on deferred payments and are in the thick of user research and price modeling.\n\nBut, the rest of this post is about the 2nd promise. To wit, I\u2019m so proud to tell you that we\u2019ve officially launched the first (pilot) cohort of the interviewing.io Technical Interview Practice Fellowship. This cohort will be focused on engineers from backgrounds that are underrepresented in tech. We are acutely aware, of course, that our first cohort couldn\u2019t capture everyone who\u2019s underrepresented, that gender and race isn\u2019t enough, and that we need to do more for our users who can\u2019t afford our price tags, regardless of who they are or where they come from.\n\nOur hope is to expand this Fellowship to anyone who needs it.\n\nWe\u2019re also working on the much harder problem of how to navigate the visa situation we\u2019re in right now (different than when we wrote the first post, sadly\u2026 but especially important to me, given that I\u2019m an immigrant myself).\n\n### What is the Fellowship, and why does it exist?\n\nBefore we tell you a little bit about the Fellows in our inaugural cohort and what the Fellowship entails, a quick word about why this matters.\n\nIn order to get a job as a software engineer, it\u2019s not enough to have a degree in the field from a top school. However you learned your coding skills, you also have to pass a series of rigorous technical interviews, focusing on analytical problem solving, algorithms, and data structures.\n\nThis interview style is controversial, in part because it\u2019s not entirely similar to the work software engineers do every day but also because 1) like standardized testing, it\u2019s a learned skill and 2) unlike standardized testing, interview results are not consistent or repeatable \u2014 the same candidate can do well in one interview and fail another one in the same day. According to our data, only about [25% of candidates are consistent in their performance from interview to interview](https://interviewing.io/blog/after-a-lot-more-data-technical-interview-performance-really-is-kind-of-arbitrary) and [women quit 7X more often than men after a poor performance](https://interviewing.io/blog/voice-modulation-gender-technical-interviews).\n\nTo account for both of these limitations, the best strategy to maximize your chances of success is to practice a lot so you can 1) get better and 2) accept that the results of a single interview are not the be-all and end-all of your future aptitude as a software engineer and that it\u2019s ok to keep trying.\n\nThe main problem created by modern interview techniques is that, despite interview practice being such a critical prerequisite to success in this field, access to practice isn\u2019t equitably distributed. We want to fix this, and we\u2019re well equipped to do so. Based on our data, engineers are twice as likely to pass a real interview after they\u2019ve done 3-5 practice sessions on our platform.\n\nOur Fellows will get these practice sessions completely for free. These will be 1:1 hour-long sessions with senior engineers from a top company who have graciously volunteered their time and expertise. Huge thank you and a big shout-out to them all.\n\nAfter each session, Fellows will get actionable feedback that will help them in their upcoming job search, and we will be helping Fellows connect with top companies as well.\n\nNote: We\u2019d like to be able to offer even more support \u2013 and are actively seeking more partners to do so. Please see the *How you can help* section below if you or your organization would like to get involved!\n\n### Why now?\n\nThe world seems to be in a place, now more than ever, to have the conversation about race, gender, socioeconomic, and other kinds of equity, in hiring. This is our small part of that conversation.\n\n### Who are the Fellows?\n\nAfter opening up our application process, we close to 1,000 submissions in a week, and (though it was really, really hard) we culled those down to 56 Fellows.\n\nOur first cohort is:\n\n- **82%** Black, Latinx, and/or Indigenous\n- **53%** women\n- **55%** senior (4+ years of experience) & **45%** junior (0-3 years of experience)\n\nHere are some of their (anonymized) stories. There were a lot of stories like these.\n\n> *My goal is to keep pressing as well as to share and give to underrepresented communities because the journey in tech can be isolating. Often I am the only one. It is critical that there are more people that look like me that are engineers \\*and\\* ascend the leadership ladder.*\n\n> *My parents immigrated from [redacted] to The Bronx without a formal education. I\u2019m the first individual in my household to graduate from college and I\u2019m the only Software Engineer in my family. I grew up in a poor neighborhood where many individuals had limited economic and educational opportunity. I aim to make the path to become a Software Engineer easier for those who were in my situation.*\n\n> *My journey to becoming a software engineer almost never happened. Throughout my undergraduate studies I was faced with having to drop out multiple times, due to the immigration status of my parents\u2026. I was tasked with assisting in my family\u2019s living situation and paying for school. I worked full time and started my own construction company in order to take care of my family and studies. It was always tough having to work 8-10 hours a day and then going to class or doing homework\u2026 Becoming a software engineer was always a goal of mine, and realizing that goal was well worth the struggle, given the struggle my parents went through to bring us here in the first place.*\n\n> *I spent 5 years in public education working directly with marginalized communities in the struggle for equity. My journey through software engineering is a continuation of this spirit of advocacy and changemaking. Software engineering is a tool to be put at the service of advocacy.*\n\n### What can I do to help?\n\nThere are a number of ways you can help and get involved!\n\n#### Help sponsor future Fellowship cohorts & create scholarships for underrepresented engineers!\n\nEvery Fellow in this first cohort represents at least 100X who are not. We have the tech to scale the hell out of this program, and all we need is backing and resources from people or organizations who recognize there\u2019s a need (donations are tax-deductible). **Please email [fellowship-sponsors@interviewing.io](mailto:fellowship-sponsors@interviewing.io) if you\u2019d like to get involved or want more information.**\n\n#### Hire through us!\n\nDespite mounting evidence that resumes are poor predictors of aptitude, companies were obsessed with where people had gone to school and worked previously. On interviewing.io, software engineers, no matter where they come from or where they\u2019re starting, can book anonymous mock interviews with senior interviewers from top companies. We use data from these interviews to identify top performers much more reliably than a resume, and fast-track them to real job interviews with employers on our platform through the same anonymous, fair process. Because we use data, not resumes, our candidates end up getting hired consistently by companies like Facebook, Uber, Twitch, Lyft, Dropbox, and many others, **and 40% of the hires we\u2019ve made to date have been candidates from non-traditional backgrounds. Many of our candidates have literally been rejected based on their resumes by the same employer who later hired them when they came through our anonymous platform** (one notable candidate was rejected 3 times from a top-tier public company based on his resume before he got hired at that same company through our anonymous interview format).\n\n**Please email [sales@interviewing.io](mailto:sales@interviewing.io) to get rolling.**\n\n#### Buy an individual practice session for someone who can\u2019t afford it\n\n**If you know individual engineers who need interview practice but can\u2019t afford it, use our [handy interview gifting feature](https://interviewing.io/gift-practice-interviews).** Interviews are $100 each. They\u2019re not cheap, but we have to price them that way to pay for interviewer time (interviewers are senior FAANG engineers) and cover our costs. Sadly that means practice interviews are not affordable to everyone. Even if you can\u2019t get involved to help us fund interviews at scale, if you know someone who needs practice but can\u2019t afford it, you can buy them an anonymous mock interview or two individually. It\u2019s the best gift you can give to an engineer who\u2019s starting their job search.\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

In my experience, one of the hardest things about negotiating your salary is knowing what to say in tough, ambiguous situations with a power balance that\u2019s not in your favor. What\u2019s OK? What\u2019s rude? What are the social norms? And so on.\n\nBefore I started [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/), I\u2019ve worked as a software engineer, an in-house recruiter, and an agency recruiter, so I\u2019ve literally been on all sides of the negotiating table. For the last few years, I\u2019ve been guest-lecturing MIT\u2019s 6.UAT, a class about technical communication for computer science majors. Every semester, negotiation is one of the most-requested topics from students. In this post, I\u2019m sharing the content of that lecture, which is targeted toward students, but has served seasoned industry folks just as well. You\u2019re never too young or too old to advocate for yourself.\n\nBtw, if you don\u2019t like reading and prefer long, rambly diatribes in front of an unsightly glass wall, I covered most of this material (and other stuff) in a webinar I did with the fine people at Udacity (where I used to run hiring) a few months ago. So, pick your poison.\n\n## Why negotiate my salary at all, especially if I\u2019m junior?\n\nIf you\u2019re early in your career, you might say that negotiation isn\u2019t worth the hassle \u2014 after all, junior roles have pretty narrow salary bands. There are a few reasons this view is short-sighted and wrong. First, though it\u2019s pretty unlikely in the grand scheme of things, if you\u2019re applying to a startup, there might come a magical day when your equity is worth something. This is especially true if you\u2019re an early employee \u2014 with a good exit, a delta of a few tenths of a percent might end up being worth a down payment on a home in San Francisco.\n\nBut, let\u2019s get real, your equity is likely worthless (except interviewing.io\u2019s equity\u2026 that\u2019s totes gonna be worth something), so let me give you a better, more immediate reason to learn to haggle early in your career, precisely because that\u2019s when the stakes are low. Humans are frighteningly adaptable creatures. Scared of public speaking? Give 3 talks. The first one will be gut-wrenchingly horrific, the stuff of nightmares. Your voice will crack, you\u2019ll mumble, and the whole time, you\u2019ll want to vomit. The next one will be nerve-wracking. The last one will mostly be OK. And after that, you\u2019ll be just fine. Same thing applies to approach anxiety, mathematical proofs, sex, and, you guessed it, salary negotiation!\n\nSo, make all the awkward, teeth-cringing mistakes now, while it doesn\u2019t matter, and where failure will cost you $5K or $10K a year. Because the further along you get in your career, the bigger the upside will be\u2026 and the bigger the downside will be for not negotiating. Not only will the salary bands be wider for senior roles, but as you get more senior, more of your comp comes from equity, and equity has an even wider range for negotiating. Negotiating your stock well can make 6-figure differences and beyond (especially if you apply some of these same skills to negotiating with investors over term sheets, should you ever start your own company)\u2026 so learn these skills (and fail) while you\u2019re young, because the older you get, the harder it\u2019s going to be to start and the more high-stakes it\u2019s going to be.\n\nSo, below, as promised, I\u2019ll give you a few archetypal, stress-inducing situations and what to say, word-for-word in each one. But first, let me address the elephant in the room\u2026\n\n## Will my offer be rescinded if I try to negotiate my salary?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, this blog post is coming out of a lecture I give at MIT. Every semester, I start the negotiation portion of the lecture with the unshakeable refrain that no one will ever rescind your offer for negotiating. Last semester was different, though. I was just starting to feel my oats and get into my talk (the negotiation piece comes about halfway through) and smugly recited the bit about offers never being rescinded, followed by my usual caveat\u2026 \u201cunless you act like a douche while negotiating.\u201d Then, a hand shot up in the back of the room. Ah ha, I thought to myself, one of the non-believers. Ready to placate him, I called on the gentleman in the back.\n\n\u201cMy offer got rescinded for negotiation.\u201d\n\nThe class broke out into uproarious laughter. I laughed too. It was kind of funny\u2026 but it was also unnerving, and I wanted to get to the bottom of it.\n\n\u201cWere you a giant jerk when you negotiated?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope.\u201d Shit, OK, what else can I come up with\u2026\n\n\u201cWere you applying at a really small company with maybe one open role?\u201d I asked, praying against hope that he\u2019d say yes.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank god.\u201d\n\nSo, there\u2019s the one exception I\u2019ve found so far to my blanket statement. After working with hundreds and hundreds of candidates back when I was still a recruiter, I had never heard or seen an offer get rescinded (and none of my candidates acted like douches while negotiating, thank god), until then. So, if you\u2019re talking to a super small company with one role that closes as soon as they find someone, yes, then they might rescind the offer.\n\nBut, to be honest, and I\u2019m not just saying this because I was wrong in front of hundreds of bloodthirsty undergrads, an early startup punishing a prospective employee for being entrepreneurial is a huge red flag to me.\n\nOK, so, now onto the bit where I tell you exactly what to say.[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n\n## What to say when asked to name the first number\n\nThere will come a time in every job search where a recruiter will ask you about your compensation expectations. This will likely happen very early in said search, maybe even during the first call you\u2019ll ever have with the company.\n\nI think this is a heinous, illaudable practice fraught with value asymmetry. Companies know their salary ranges and roughly what you\u2019re worth to them before they ever talk to you (barring phenomenal performance in interviews which kicks you into a different band). And they know what cost of living is in your area. So they already have all the info they need about you, while you have none about them or the role or even your market value. Sure, there are some extenuating circumstances where you are too expensive, e.g. you\u2019re like an L6 at Google and are talking to an early stage startup that can only afford to pay you 100K a year in base, but honestly even in that situation, if the job is cool enough and if you have the savings, you might take it anyway.\n\nSo, basically, telling them something will only hurt you and never help you. So don\u2019t do it. Now, here\u2019s exactly what to say when asked to name the first number.\n\nAt this point, I don\u2019t feel equipped to throw out a number because I\u2019d like to find out more about the opportunity first \u2013 right now, I simply don\u2019t have the data to be able to say something concrete. If you end up making me an offer, I would be more than happy to iterate on it if needed and figure out something that works. I also promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.\n\nTADA!\n\n## What to say when you\u2019re handed an exploding offer\n\nExploding offers, in my book, are the last bastion of the incompetent. The idea goes something like this\u2026 if we give a candidate an aggressive deadline, they\u2019ll have less of a chance to talk to other companies. Game theory for the insipid.\n\nHaving been on the other side of the table, I know just how arbitrary offer deadlines often are. Deadlines make sense when there is a limited number of positions and applicants all come in at the same time (e.g. internships). They do not make any sense in this market, where companies are perpetually hiring all the time \u2014 therefore it\u2019s an entirely artificial construct. Joel Spolsky, the creator of Trello and Stack Overflow, had something particularly biting to say on the matter of exploding offers many years ago (the full post, [Exploding Offer Season](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/11/26/exploding-offer-season/), is really good):\n\n*\u201cHere\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. You\u2019re thinking, well, that\u2019s a good company, not my first choice, but still a good offer, and I\u2019d hate to lose this opportunity. And you don\u2019t know for sure if your number one choice would even hire you. So you accept the offer at your second-choice company and never go to any other interviews. And now, you lost out. You\u2019re going to spend several years of your life in some cold dark cubicle with a crazy boss who couldn\u2019t program a twenty out of an ATM, while some recruiter somewhere gets a $1000 bonus because she was better at negotiating than you were.\u201d*\n\nEven in the case of internships, offer deadlines need not be as aggressive as they often are, and I\u2019m happy to report that many college career centers have taken stands against exploding offers. Nevertheless, if you\u2019re not a student or if your school hasn\u2019t outlawed this vile practice, here\u2019s exactly what to say if it ever happens to you.\n\nI would very much appreciate having a bit more time. I\u2019m very excited about Company X. At the same time, choosing where I work is extremely important to me. Of course, I will not drag things out, and I will continue to keep you in the loop, but I hope you can understand my desire to make as informed of a decision as possible. How about I make a decision by\u2026?\n\n## The reverse used car salesman\u2026 or what to say to always get more\n\nAt the end of the day, the best way to get more money is to have other offers. I know, I know, interviewing sucks and is a giant gauntlet-slog, but in many cases, having just one other offer (so, I don\u2019t know, spending a few extra days of your time spread over a few weeks) can get you at least $10K extra. It\u2019s a pretty rational, clear-cut argument for biting the slog-bullet and doing a few more interviews.\n\nOne anecdote I\u2019ll share on the subject goes like this. A few years ago, a close friend of mine who\u2019s notoriously bad at negotiation and hates it with a passion was interviewing at one of the big 4 companies. I was trying to talk him into getting out there just a little bit, for the love of god, and talk to at least one more company. I ended up introducing him to a mid-sized startup where he quickly got an onsite interview. Just mentioning that he had an onsite at this company to his recruiter from the bigco got him an extra $5K in his signing bonus.\n\nOffers are, of course, better than onsites, but in a pinch, even onsites will do\u2026 because every onsite increases your odds of not accepting the offer from the company you\u2019re negotiating with. So, let\u2019s say you do have some offers. Do you reveal the details?\n\nThe answer is that it depends. If the cash parts of the offers you have are worth more than the one you have in hand, then you can reveal the details. If they\u2019re worth more in total but less in cash, it\u2019s a bit dicier because equity at smaller companies is kind of worthless\u2026 you can still use it as leverage if you tell the story that that equity is worth more to YOU, but that\u2019s going to take a bit more finesse, so if you\u2019ve never negotiated before, you might want to hold off.\n\nIf the cash part of your equity is not worth more, it\u2019s sufficient to say you have offers and when pressed, you can simply say that you\u2019re not sharing the details (it\u2019s ok not to share the details).\n\nBut whether you reveal details or not, here\u2019s the basic formula for getting more. See why I call it the reverse used car salesman?\n\nI have the following onsites/offers, and I\u2019m still interviewing at Company X and Company Y, but I\u2019m really excited about this opportunity and will drop my other stuff and **SIGN TODAY** if\u2026\n\nSo, \u201cif\u201d what? I propose listing 3 things you want, which will typically be:\n\n- Equity\n- Salary\n- Signing/relocation bonus\n\nThe reason I list 3 things above isn\u2019t because I expect you\u2019ll be able to get all 3, but this way, you\u2019re giving the person you\u2019re negotiating with some options. In my experience, you\u2019ll likely get 2 out of the 3.\n\nSo, what amounts should you ask for when executing on the reverse used car salesman? It\u2019s usually easier to get equity and bonuses than salary (signing bonus is a one-off rather than something that repeats every year). Therefore, it\u2019s not crazy to ask for 1.5X-2X the equity and an extra 10-15% in salary. For the bonus portion, a lot depends on the size of the company, but if you\u2019re talking to a company that\u2019s beyond seed stage, you can safely ask for at least 20% of your base salary as a signing bonus.[2](#user-content-fn-2)\n\nWhat if the company says no to all or most of these and are a big enough brand to where you don\u2019t have much of a leg to stand on? You can still get creative. One of our users told me about a sweet deal he came up with \u2014 he said he\u2019d sign today if he got to choose the team he could join and had a specific team in mind.\n\n## Other negotiation resources\n\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of this post, there are plenty of blog posts and resources on the internets about negotiation, so I\u2019ll just mention two of my favorites. The first is a riveting, [first-hand account of negotiation adventures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-not-to-bomb-your-offer-negotiation-c46bb9bc7dea) from one of my favorite writers in this space, Haseeb Qureshi. In his post, Haseeb talks about how he negotiated for a 250K (total package) offer with Airbnb and what he learned along the way. It\u2019s one of the most honest and thoughtful accounts of the negotiation process I\u2019ve ever read.\n\nThe second post I\u2019ll recommend is a [seminal work in salary negotiation by Patrick McKenzie](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/) (patio11 on Hacker News, in case that\u2019s more recognizable). I read it back when I was still an engineer, and it was one of those things that indelibly changed how I looked at the world. I still madly link anyone and everyone who asks me about negotiation to this piece of writing, and it\u2019s still bookmarked in my browser.\n\nIf you\u2019re an interviewing.io user and have a job offer or five that you\u2019re weighing and want to know exactly what to say when negotiating in your own nuanced, unique situation, please email me, and I\u2019ll whisper sweet, fiscal nothings in your ear like a modern-day Cyrano de Bergerac wooing the sweet mistress that is capitalism.[3](#user-content-fn-3)\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1.

[\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-3)\n4. In the early days of interviewing.io, we tried to charge a flat per-hire fee in lieu of a percentage of salary, precisely for this reason -- we wanted to set ourselves up as an entirely impartial platform where lining up with our candidates' best interests was codified into our incentive structure. Companies were pretty weirded out by the flat fee, so we went back to doing percentages, but these days we're moving over as many of our customers to subscription as possible -- it's cheaper for them, better for candidates, and I won't lie that I like to see that recurring revenue.

It\u2019s bad for business. We did a [whole study](https://interviewing.io/blog/people-cant-gauge-their-own-interview-performance-and-that-makes-them-harder-to-hire) on this. It turns out that 43% of all candidates consistently underrate their technical interview performance, and 25% of all candidates consistently think they failed when they actually passed.\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly important is that there\u2019s a statistically significant relationship between whether people think they did well in an interview and whether they\u2019d want to work with you. In other words, in every interview cycle, some portion of interviewees are losing interest in joining your company just because they don\u2019t think they did well, even when they actually did.\n\nPractically speaking, giving instant feedback to successful candidates can do wonders for increasing your close rate.\n\nGiving feedback will not only make candidates you want today more likely to join your team, but it\u2019s also crucial to hiring the candidates you might want down the road. Technical interview outcomes are erratic, and according to our data, [only about 25% of candidates perform consistently from interview to interview](https://interviewing.io/blog/after-a-lot-more-data-technical-interview-performance-really-is-kind-of-arbitrary). This means that the same candidate you reject today might be someone you want to hire in 6 months. It\u2019s in your interest to forge a good relationship with them now.\n\n## But won't we get sued?\n\nI surveyed founders, hiring managers, recruiters, and labor lawyers to understand why anyone who\u2019s ever gone through interviewer training has been told in no uncertain terms to not give feedback.\n\nThe main reason: companies are scared of getting sued.\n\nAs it turns out, literally zero companies (at least in the US) have ever been sued by an engineer who received constructive post-interview feedback. As some of my lawyer contacts pointed out, a lot of cases get settled out of court, and that data is much harder to get, but given what we know, the odds of getting sued after giving useful feedback are extremely low.\n\n## What about candidates getting defensive?\n\nFor every interviewer on our platform, we track two key metrics: the candidate experience score and the interviewer calibration score.\n\nFor our purposes here, all you need to know is that the candidate experience is a measure of how likely candidates are likely to come back after interviewing with a given interviewer, and the interviewer calibration score tell us whether a given interviewer is too strict or too lenient, based on how their candidates do in subsequent, REAL interviews (which we host on our platform as well). If an interviewer continually gives good scores to candidates who fail real interviews, they\u2019re too lenient, and vice versa.\n\nWhen you put the candidate experience score and the interviewer calibration score together, you can reason about the value of delivering honest feedback! To wit, below is a graph of the average candidate experience score as a function of interviewer accuracy, representing data from over 1,000 distinct interviewers (comprising ~100K interviews).\n\nAs you can see, the candidate experience score peaks right at the point where interviewers are neither too strict or too lenient but are, in Goldilocks terms, just right. It drops off pretty dramatically on either side after that.\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/The_best_calibrated_interviewers_are_also_the_best_rated_n_1000_cfd3ee6c28.png)\n\nIn short, based on our data, we\u2019re confident that, if you do it right, candidates won\u2019t get defensive and that the benefits of delivering honest feedback greatly outweigh the risks.\n\n## The playbook for how to deliver honest (and sometimes harsh) feedback\n\nThe first and most important thing is to NOT focus on the outcome but rather to get specific right away \u2014 this will keep your candidate from getting defensive and will set them up to actually hear and internalize your feedback.\n\nIn other words, whether they did well or poorly, don\u2019t tell them right away. Instead, dive into a constructive, detailed assessment of their performance. Reframing feedback in this way takes some practice, but your candidates won\u2019t push you to give them the outcome. Instead, their attention will be redirected to the details, which will make the pass/fail part much more of an afterthought (and, in some cases, entirely moot). After all, why do people get defensive? It\u2019s not because they failed! Rather, it\u2019s because they don\u2019t understand why and feel powerless.\n\nTo help start the conversation, here are some leading questions for you to consider:\n\n- Did they ask enough questions about constraints before getting into coding or before starting to design a system?\n- Go over specific code snippets or portions of their solution, and talk about what they could have done better.\n- Could their solution have been more efficient?\n- Did they discuss and reason about tradeoffs?\n- Did they make mistakes when discussing time or space complexity? What were those specific mistakes?\n- Did they make any mistakes when trying to use their programming language of choice idiomatically (e.g., iterating in Python or JavaScript)?\n- For systems design questions, did they jump to suggesting a specific database, load balancer, tool, etc. without reasoning through why that tool is the right choice for the job?\n\nNote that to answer these questions well and to give specific, constructive feedback, it\u2019s critical to take notes, ideally timestamped ones, during the interview. Then you can always go back to your notes and say, \u201cHey, you jumped into coding just 5 minutes into the interview. Typically, you\u2019ll want to spend a few minutes asking questions.\u201d\n\nAnd, of course, specific feedback really does mean being specific. One of the kindest, albeit most labor-intensive, things you can do is walk through their code with them, point out places where they went astray, and note what they could have done better.\n\nOne other useful pattern for giving feedback is to share objective benchmarks for a given interview question, both with respect to times and number of hints given. If you\u2019re a great interviewer, you probably do something called layering of complexity, where after a candidate successfully solves a question, you change up the constraints in real time. You may even do this 3-4 times during the interview if a candidate is blowing through your questions quickly.\n\nThis means that you know exactly how many constraint changes you\u2019ll be able to go through with a low-performing candidate vs. a mediocre one vs. one who\u2019s truly exceptional.\n\nYour candidates don\u2019t know this, though! In fact, candidates commonly overestimate their performance in interviews because they don\u2019t realize how many layers of complexity a question has. In this scenario, a candidate will finish, say, the first layer successfully right before time is called. They walk away thinking they did well, when in reality, the interviewer is benchmarking them against people who can complete 3 layers in that amount of time.\n\nHow do you put all of this info to practical use? Let your candidates know what the benchmarks are for a top-performing candidate at the end of the interview. For instance, you could say something like, \u201cIn the 45 minutes we spent working this problem, the strongest performers usually complete the brute-force solution in about 20 minutes, optimize it until it runs in linear time (which takes another 10 minutes), and then, in the last 15 minutes, successfully complete an enhancement where, instead of an array, your input is a stream of integers.\u201d\n\nAlso, let them know exactly how many hints are par for the course. Just like with how much time should elapse for different parts of the interview, candidates have no idea what \u201cnormal\u201d is when it comes to the number and detail level of hints. For instance, if a candidate needed a hint about which data structure to use, followed by a hint about what time complexity is associated with that data structure, followed by a hint about a common off-by-one error that comes up, you may want to tell them that the strongest performers usually need a hint about one of those things, but not all three.\n\nThe key to communicating these benchmarks constructively is, of course, to be as specific as possible with runtimes or space constraints or whatever success metric you\u2019re using.\n\nOne final technique some of our interviewers employ is to ask their candidate to perform a detailed self-assessment at the end of the interview before giving feedback. This is an advanced maneuver, and if you\u2019re completely new to giving synchronous feedback, I wouldn\u2019t do it in your first few interviews. However, once you get comfortable, this approach can be a great way to zero in on the areas that the candidate needs the most help on immediately.\n\nIf you do end up going the self-assessment route, it\u2019s good to ask your candidate some leading questions. For instance, for algorithmic interviews, you can ask:\n\n- How well do you think you did at solving the problem and arriving at an optimized solution?\n- How clean was your code?\n- Where are some places that you struggled?\n\nWhile the candidate is responding, take notes (perhaps even in your shared editor!), and then go through their points together, and speak to each point in detail. For instance, if a candidate rates themselves well on code quality but poorly on their ability to solve the problem, you can agree or disagree and give them benchmarks (as discussed above) for both.\n\nHere\u2019s the summary playbook:\n\n- Take detailed notes during the interview, ideally with timestamps, that you can refer to later.\n- DON\u2019T lead with whether they passed or failed. Instead, get specific and constructive right away. This will divert the candidate\u2019s attention away from the outcome and put them in the right headspace to receive feedback.\n- As much as possible, give objective benchmarks for performance. For instance, tell candidates that the strongest performers are usually able to finish part 1 within 20 minutes, part 2 within 10 minutes, and part 3 within 15 minutes, with at most 1 hint.\n- Once you get comfortable with giving feedback, you can try asking candidates to do a self-assessment and then use it as a rubric that you can go down, point by point.\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

It\u2019s a classic, and the main point is that good design should make everything painfully obvious to users without demanding anything of them.\n\nResumes are just the same. Your resume shouldn\u2019t make recruiters think. It should serve up the most important things about you on a platter that they can digest in 30 seconds or less.\n\nBefore I share some resume tips, there\u2019s something important I want to reiterate: **Don\u2019t spend a lot of time on your resume**. You can read my [piece about how resume writing is snake oil](https://interviewing.io/blog/why-resume-writing-is-snake-oil), but the TL;DR is that recruiters spend a median of 30 seconds looking at resumes, and most of that is spent looking for top-tier companies. If you don\u2019t have top-tier companies (and in some cases niche skills), wordsmithing your bullets or rearranging your sections or changing your layout won\u2019t help. If you do have top-tier companies, sometimes doing some wordsmithing and rearrangement will help\u2026 *if your top company experience or niche skills are buried.*\n\nIf you don\u2019t have top-tier brands, the best bang for your buck is to switch from online applications to hiring manager outreach. [Here\u2019s how to do it.](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-to-get-in-the-door-at-top-companies-cold-out-reach-to-hiring-managers-part-2)\n\nWith that said, I know that no matter what I say, people will still grind on their resumes instead of doing outreach. Grinding on resumes is safe. Outreach is scary and opens you up to personal (rather than impersonal) rejection. So, look, if you\u2019re going to do *something* to your resume, let\u2019s make sure that that something is low-effort and high-return. Unlike the endless resume tweaking that most candidates do, these changes directly address how recruiters actually read resumes.\n\nHere we go.\n\n## Stop putting filler buzzwords in your \"About\" section. Use it to spell out the most impressive things about you.\n\nYour \"About\" or \"Summary\" section is prime real estate. Yet so many candidates fill this section with meaningless jargon like \"passionate self-starter\" or \"detail-oriented team player.\"\nInstead, use this section to explicitly tell recruiters the 2-3 most impressive things about you in plain English. This is your chance to control the narrative. *Want recruiters to take something away from reading your resume?* Don\u2019t assume they\u2019ll figure it out. They\u2019re not reading it long enough to intuit anything. Spell it out for them verbatim in this section.\nDo this, not that:\n\n\u274c Results-driven full-stack engineer with a passion for scalable systems and user-centric design  \n\u2705 Senior engineer with 3 years at Amazon, promoted twice in 3 years (2X the company average)[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n\n## Don\u2019t include your GPA if it\u2019s under 3.8\n\nThis is simple but effective: only include your GPA if it's 3.8 or higher[2](#user-content-fn-2). A middling GPA doesn't help your case and might inadvertently signal academic mediocrity.\n\nIf your GPA isn't stellar, focus on other academic achievements: hackathons, technical competitions, fellowships or scholarships. These provide better signals about your capabilities than a so-so GPA.\n\n## Context matters for lesser-known companies\n\nIf you've worked at Google or Facebook, recruiters instantly get what kind of company you're coming from. But when you have \"TechStartup123\" on your resume, they have no idea what they're looking at or how impressive it might be.\n\nFor lesser-known companies, include a one-line description explaining what the company does, along with any impressive metrics or investors:\n\n\u274c \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc.\"  \n\u2705 \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc. ($50M Series B from Sequoia, 2M+ active users)\"\n\nThis simple addition provides crucial context that helps recruiters evaluate your experience properly. Without it, they might discount valuable experience simply because they don't recognize the company name.\n\n## Avoid the \"job-hopper\" misperception\n\nHere's a common mistake: listing each role at the same company as if they were separate jobs. This can make recruiters think you've job-hopped, which is often seen as a red flag.\n\nInstead, group different roles under the same company heading:\n\n\u274c Listing separate entries for \"Junior Developer at XYZ\" and \"Senior Developer at XYZ\"  \n\u2705 \"XYZ Company - Senior Developer (2021-Present) - Junior Developer (2019-2021) *Promoted in 2 years vs. company average of 3.5 years*\"\n\nThe second format clearly shows growth within a single company and explicitly highlights faster-than-average promotion, which is a strong positive signal. (You may also want to carry over your promotion cadence into your \u201cAbout\u201d section, as you saw above.)\n\n## Be crystal clear about your work authorization status\n\nThis one is particularly crucial if you have a foreign-sounding name and/or education outside the US. I've seen many qualified candidates get passed over because recruiters assumed they needed visa sponsorship when they actually didn't. Don't leave this to chance.\n\nMake your work status explicit in your header or summary section:\n\n\u274c No mention of work authorization (leaving recruiters to guess)  \n\u2705 \"US Citizen\" or \"Green Card Holder\" or \"Authorized to work in the US without visa sponsorship\"\n\n## Career changers: provide context about the change\n\nIf you've switched careers, your resume can look confusing without proper context. Recruiters might struggle to understand why someone with your background is applying for this role, or they might not recognize how your previous experience translates to your current trajectory.\n\nAddress this head-on in your \u201cAbout\u201d section.\n\n\u274c Listing previous career experience with no explanation of your transition  \n\u2705 \"Transitioned from marketing to software engineering in 2021 after completing a bootcamp\" or \"Former accountant who pivoted to data science through self-study and online courses while continuing full-time work\"\n\nThis context helps recruiters understand your timeline and puts your current title and achievements in perspective. Without it, you risk serious misinterpretation:\n\n1. Recruiters might think you're far more junior than you actually are in your new field (potentially ruling you out for appropriate-level positions)\n2. Or conversely, they might assume you have years of relevant experience in your new field (and then wonder why you haven't achieved more in that time)\n\nBoth misinterpretations can be fatal to your application. By providing a clear timeline of your transition, you help recruiters accurately gauge your experience level and set appropriate expectations. This transparency also demonstrates valuable traits like adaptability and determination.\n\nAnd here's another key point for career changers: you don't need to list all your previous positions before the transition... unless they're impressive. Be selective about what pre-transition experience you include:\n\n\u274c DON'T include mundane or irrelevant details from your previous career that add nothing to your current narrative. Your three years as a retail associate before becoming a developer probably won't strengthen your software engineering application.  \n\u2705 DO highlight prestigious achievements from your previous career. If you were, say, a concert pianist, a lawyer who graduated from a top-tier law school, or a management consultant at McKinsey, absolutely include that. These signal that you're smart and high-achieving, regardless of domain.\n\n## In conclusion\n\nIf you do all these things, you may or may not see a return. After all, even the impact of these tweaks pales in comparison to having top brands on your resume. But, given that these will take you a few minutes to do, it doesn\u2019t hurt.

A tale of two labor markets.\n\nBy Aline Lerner and Maxim Massenkoff | Published: April 10, 2023; Last updated: May 28, 2023\n\n*Note: This post originally appeared in [TechCrunch on April 3, 2023](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/03/should-you-post-that-youre-opentowork-a-tale-of-two-labor-markets/).*\n\nLinkedIn members face a dilemma when choosing whether to mark themselves as #OpenToWork. On the one hand, it sends a clear and useful signal to recruiters and hiring managers that you\u2019re open to new job opportunities. On the other hand, the badge can lump you with a crowd of people who are more likely to be unemployed or unhappy with their jobs, which could be seen as a negative sign \u2013 you know, the whole Groucho Marx thing:\\* I don\u2019t want to belong to any club that would accept me as one of its members.\\*\n\nIf you\u2019re job hunting, should you list yourself as Open To Work? Does doing so carry a negative signal? And with the recent deluge of layoffs at tech companies, has the meaning of #OpenToWork changed? We decided to find out!\n\n## The correlation between LinkedIn #OpenToWork and interviewing.io interviews\n\ninterviewing.io is an interview practice platform and recruiting marketplace for engineers. Engineers use us for mock interviews. Companies use us to hire top performers. In our lifetime, we\u2019ve hosted over 100k technical interviews, split between mocks and real ones. To test whether listing yourself as #OpenToWork on the profile section of your LinkedIn is a good thing to do, we aggregated pass/fail rates in the interviews our users did and cross-referenced them with whether users marked themselves as #OpenToWork on their LinkedIn profiles. We also made sure to check their LinkedIns twice: once in early 2021, when there were practically [no tech layoffs](https://layoffs.fyi/), and again in early 2023, in the wake of the worst round of tech layoffs since 2001.\n\nWhy did we check twice? Economic theory suggests that the people laid off or searching for a job in boom times are different from those laid off in a recession. If you are let go or cannot find a job when companies are flush, it might be that you were laid off for performance reasons or can never get past a screening call. On the other hand, someone who suffered from an across-the-board layoff in a time of economic crisis could be perfectly-capable: just a casualty of macroeconomic forces.\n\nWorried about layoffs, or just want to be prepared? Sign up for anonymous mock interviews with engineers from top companies.\n\n[See available times](https://interviewing.io/signup)\n\n![](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcta.47351a0d.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nWe found that being Open To Work is far more common now. Among the over ten thousand people that we had LinkedIn data for, **only 1.4% had the badge in 2021 compared to 4.2% in the first quarter of 2023**.\n\n## Is posting #OpenToWork on LinkedIn good or bad?\n\nWe found that being Open To Work was a *negative* signal for those who had it up in 2021, a boom time for tech hiring. The chart below shows the percentage of people who passed their interviews\u2014our summary measure of candidate performance. On average, about 51 percent of candidates pass their interviews. In contrast, those with #OpenToWork badges in 2021 were fully 7 percentage points below that, at 44%.\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/percent_hirable_and_open_to_work_f863aa6a5b.png)\n\nThe finding confirms that there can be negative selection among job seekers. Being upfront about looking for a job\u2014at least in 2021\u2014was indeed a bad sign.\n\n**But strikingly, this result flips in present times. Engineers who are currently Open To Work are actually positively selected relative to everyone else. Using the LinkedIn Open To Work feature is a good sign in these rough times: 56% of engineers tagged as OpenToWork passed their interviews, 5 percentage points more than average. The difference in these effects is highly statistically significant.** And we get the same results when we leave out anyone who has worked at a FAANG company\u2014in case the recent [engineering layoffs](https://interviewing.io/blog/2022-layoffs-engineers-vs-other-departments) simply flooded the market with engineers from those top-tier companies.\n\n## Before using the Open To Work feature, consider the job market\n\nAnecdotally, we\u2019ve heard that layoffs in 2022 and 2023, especially at large companies, were not performance-based. In many cases, cuts were based on an employee's start date\u2014those who hired last were the first on the chopping block. In some cases, entire teams were cut \u2013 if a team\u2019s product wasn\u2019t close enough to revenue, they ended up on the chopping block, independently of how strong the engineers on that team actually were.\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tweet_google_layoffs_81e3f27bb4.png)\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/blind_layoffs_aren_t_about_performance_d0b2a7db8e.png)\n\nWe were excited to see that this anecdotal perception held up in the data.\n\nThat said, people who are OpenToWork have not necessarily been laid off. In uncertain times, it\u2019s more common for workers to be openly searching for jobs. The macroeconomic forces could normalize a more aggressive on-the job search, which might also pull more talented\u2014but still employed\u2014people into checking OpenToWork.\n\nRegardless of layoff composition, in boom times, openly searching for a job can be a negative signal. But during downturns, the rules change, and openly looking for work becomes much more \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nThe signal to hiring managers is clear: because of the rocky economic times, good workers are out there looking for jobs, and displaying #OpenToWork on your profile photo is no longer a negative signal. While hiring has slowed across many tech companies, those with the budget will find a better pool to choose from, and those who were laid off in late 2022/early 2023 might be among the most impressive candidates.\n\nIf you use LinkedIn and are looking for a new job, we wouldn\u2019t go as far as recommending that you list yourself as Open To Work because of the potential residual bias associated with that tag. We would, however, encourage you to feel no shame about having been impacted by layoffs.\n\nThe data is clear, after all\u2014the pool of engineering job seekers has never been more talented.\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

But it is bad at recruiting.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: April 10, 2024; Last updated: April 16, 2024\n\n*Note: We\u2019ve reached out to Bloomberg, asking them to share their data and clarify their findings, ahead of publishing this piece. If it turns out that they used a different method for statistical significance testing or if we missed something, we\u2019ll gladly retract the part of this post that\u2019s about their results.*\n\nRecently, Bloomberg published an article called \u201c[OpenAI\u2019s GPT is a recruiter\u2019s dream tool. Tests show there\u2019s racial bias](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-openai-gpt-hiring-racial-discrimination/).\u201d In this piece, the Bloomberg team ran a clever test where they had ChatGPT review nearly identical resumes with just the names changed to include typically Black, White, Asian, and Hispanic names. Their analysis uncovered racial bias.\n\nBloomberg had published their numbers on GitHub, so we were able to check their work. When we re-ran the numbers, we saw that they hadn\u2019t done statistical significance testing and that there was, in fact, no evidence of racial bias in Bloomberg's data set. However, when we ran our own tests, we discovered that ChatGPT is indeed bad at judging resumes. It\u2019s not bad because it\u2019s racist. It\u2019s bad because it\u2019s prone to a different kind of bias, the same kind of bias as human recruiters \u2014 over-indexing on candidates\u2019 pedigrees: whether they\u2019ve worked at a top company and/or whether they attended a top school. Pedigree can be somewhat predictive (especially where people worked), but ChatGPT is significantly overestimating its importance and doing a disservice to candidates from non-traditional backgrounds as a result.\n\n## The Bloomberg study\n\nHere\u2019s what the team at Bloomberg did (taken verbatim from their piece):\n\n> We used demographically-distinct names as proxies for race and gender, a common practice used to audit algorithms\u2026 Altogether we produced 800 demographically-distinct names: 100 names each for males and females who are either Black, White, Hispanic or Asian\u2026\n>\n> To test for name-based discrimination, Bloomberg prompted OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to rank resumes for a real job description for four different roles from Fortune 500 companies: HR specialist, software engineer, retail manager and financial analyst.\n>\n> For each role, we generated eight nearly-identical resumes using GPT-4. The resumes were edited to have the same educational background, years of experience, and last job title. We removed years of education, as well as any objectives or personal statements.\n>\n> We then randomly assigned a distinct name from each of the eight demographic groups [Black, White, Hispanic, Asian, and men and women for each] to each of the resumes.\n>\n> Next, we shuffled the order of resumes, to account for order effects, and asked GPT to rank the candidates.\n\nThe authors reported that ChatGPT shows racial bias across all groups, except for retail managers ranked by GPT-4.\n\nMore specifically:\n\n> [We] found that resumes labeled with names distinct to Black Americans were the least likely to be ranked as the top candidates for financial analyst and software engineer roles. Those with names distinct to Black women were top-ranked for a software engineering role only 11% of the time by GPT \u2014 36% less frequently than the best-performing group.\n>\n> The analysis also found that GPT\u2019s gender and racial preferences differed depending on the particular job that a candidate was evaluated for. GPT does not consistently disfavor any one group, but will pick winners and losers depending on the context. For example, GPT seldom ranked names associated with men as the top candidate for HR and retail positions, two professions historically dominated by women. GPT was nearly twice as likely to rank names distinct to Hispanic women as the top candidate for an HR role compared to each set of resumes with names distinct to men. Bloomberg also found clear preferences when running tests with the less-widely used GPT-4 \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s newer model that the company has promoted as less biased.\n\nThe team also, commendably, [published their results on GitHub](https://github.com/BloombergGraphics/2024-openai-gpt-hiring-racial-discrimination), so we tried our hand at reproducing them. What we found was starkly different from what Bloomberg reported.\n\nBefore we get into what we found, here\u2019s what we did.\n\nIn their results, Bloomberg published the rates at which both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 chose each demographic as the top candidate. The Bloomberg analysts ran a lot of trials for each job: ChatGPT was asked 1,000 times to rank 8 resumes for the HR specialist job, for example. And if ChatGPT had gender or racial bias, each group should in general be the top pick 125 times (or 12.5% of the time, given that there were 1000 data points).\n\nWhere are we going with this? Stats nerds might have noticed a glaring omission from the Bloomberg piece: statistical significance testing and p-values. Why is that important? Even with 1,000 trials, a perfectly unbiased resume sorter would not give you exactly equal proportions, picking each group precisely 125 times. Instead, purely random variation could mean that one group is picked 112 times and another is picked 128 times, without there actually being any bias. Therefore, you need to run some tests to see if the results you got were by chance or because there truly is a pattern of some kind. Once you run the test, the p-value tells you the probability that a certain set of selection rates are consistent with chance, and in this case, consistent with a random (and, therefore, unbiased) sorting of resumes.\n\nWe calculated the p-values for each group[1](#user-content-fn-1). What we found was starkly different from what Bloomberg reported.\n\n## Where the Bloomberg study went wrong\n\nGiven the nature of our business, we looked at software engineers first. Here are the results of Bloomberg having run software engineering resumes through GPT-4 for all 8 groups (the column titled \u201cobsfreq\u201d) as well as our calculated p-value.\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbloomberg_chi2_gpt4_software_78ea5edfd6.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nA\\_M = Asian man, A\\_W = Asian woman, etc. 12.5% would be the expected rate at which a candidate from each group would be the top choice (\u201cexpperc\u201d). Out of 1000 candidates, that\u2019s 125 each (\u201cexpfreq\u201d). Finally, \u201cobsfreq\u201d is the observed frequency of the top candidate being from each group, taken from Bloomberg\u2019s results.\n\nIt\u2019s convention that you want your p-value to be less than 0.05 to declare something statistically significant \u2013 in this case, that would mean less than 5% chance that the results were due to randomness. This p-value of 0.2442 is way higher than that. As it happened, we couldn\u2019t reproduce statistical significance for software engineers when using GPT-3.5 either. **Using Bloomberg\u2019s numbers, ChatGPT does NOT appear to have a racial bias when it comes to judging software engineers\u2019 resumes.**[2](#user-content-fn-2) **The results appear to be more noise than signal.**\n\nWe then re-ran the numbers for the eight race/gender combinations, using the same method as above. In the table below, you can see the results. TRUE means that there is a racial bias. FALSE obviously means that there isn't. We also shared our calculated p-values. **The TL;DR is that GPT-3.5 DOES show racial bias for both HR specialists and financial analysts but NOT for software engineers or retail managers. Most importantly, GPT-4 does not show racial bias for ANY of the race/gender combinations.**[3](#user-content-fn-3)\n\n| Occupation | GPT 3.5 (Statistically significant? \u2016 p-value) | GPT 4 (Statistically significant? \u2016 p-value) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Financial analyst | TRUE \u2016 0.0000 | FALSE \u2016 0.2034 |\n| Software engineer | FALSE \u2016 0.4736 | FALSE \u2016 0.1658 |\n| HR specialist | TRUE \u2016 0.0000 | FALSE (but it\u2019s close) \u2016 0.0617 |\n| Retail manager | FALSE \u2016 0.2229 | FALSE \u2016 0.6654 |\n\nThat\u2019s great, right? Well, not so fast. Before we deemed ChatGPT as competent at judging resumes, we wanted to run a test of our own, specifically for software engineers (because, again, that\u2019s our area of expertise). The results of this test were not encouraging.\n\n## How we tested ChatGPT\n\ninterviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform, where our users get paired with senior/staff/principal-level FAANG engineers for interview practice. We also connect top performers with top-tier companies, regardless of how they look on paper. In our lifetime, we\u2019ve hosted >100k technical interviews, split between the aforementioned mock interviews and real ones. In other words, we have a bunch of useful, indicative historical performance data about software engineers.[4](#user-content-fn-4) So we decided to use that data as a sanity check.\n\n### The setup\n\nWe asked ChatGPT (GPT4, specifically *gpt-4-0125-preview*) to grade several thousand LinkedIn profiles belonging to people who have practiced on interviewing.io before. For each profile, we asked ChatGPT to give the person a coding score between 1 and 10, where someone with a 10 would be a top 10% coder. In order to improve the quality of the response, we asked it to first give its reasoning followed by the coding score.\n\nWe want to be very clear here that we did not share any performance data with ChatGPT or share with ChatGPT any information about our users \u2014 we just asked it to make value judgments about publicly available LinkedIn profiles. Then we compared those value judgments with our data on our end.\n\n## How ChatGPT performed\n\nThere is a correlation between what ChatGPT says and how the coder performed on a real technical screen. The tool performs better than a random guess\u2026 but not by much. **To put these results in perspective**, overall, 47% of coders pass the screen. The ChatGPT score can split them into two groups: one that has a 45% chance and one with a 50% chance. So it gives you a bit more information on whether someone will succeed, but not much.\n\nBelow are two more granular ways of looking at ChatGPT\u2019s performance. The first is a modified calibration plot, and the second is a ROC curve.\n\n### Calibration plot\n\nIn this plot, we take each predicted probability from ChatGPT (e.g., 0.4112) and assign it to one of 10 equally-spaced deciles. Decile 1 is the 10% of profiles with the lowest probability. Decile 10 is the 10% of people with the highest probability.\n\nThen, for each decile, we plot the actual probability of those candidates performing well in interviews (i.e., what portion of them actually passed interviews on interviewing.io). As you can see, the plot is something of a mess \u2014 for all deciles that ChatGPT came up with, those candidates actually passed about half the time. The ideal plot (\u201cAn excellent model\u201d) would have a much steeper slope, with way fewer passing in the bottom decile than the top decile.\n\n![How ChatGPT predictions compare to actual performance on interviewing.io](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fchatgpt_decile_calibration_overall_added_lines_674eab2b9f.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nWe asked GPT-4 to judge several thousand LinkedIn profiles belonging to people who have practiced on interviewing.io before. Then we split up its predictions into deciles \u2014 10% buckets and compared to how those users actually performed. A great model would have bad performance in the first decile and then improve sharply and steadily.\n\n### ROC curve\n\nAnother way to judge ChatGPT\u2019s performance at this task is to look at a ROC curve. This curve graphs the true positive rate of a model against the false positive rate. It\u2019s a standard way of judging how accurate an ML model is because it lets the viewer see how it performs at different acceptable false positive rates \u2014 for cancer diagnostics, you may be OK with a very high false positive rate, for instance. For eng recruiting, you likely will not be!\n\nRelated to ROC curves is the AUC, or the area under the curve. A perfect model would have a 100% true positive rate for every possible false positive rate, and so the area under the curve would be 1. A model that\u2019s basically the same as guessing would have a true positive rate that equals the false positive rate (AUC = 0.5). With that in mind, here\u2019s the ROC curve and the AUC for ChatGPT judging resumes \u2014 with an overall AUC of about 0.55, it\u2019s only barely better than random guesses.\n\n![When asked to judge resumes, ChatGPT doesn't perform better than chance](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fchatgpt_oneshot_roc_cca5b11e77.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nWe asked GPT-4 to judge several thousand LinkedIn profiles belonging to people who have practiced on interviewing.io before. It performed barely better than guessing.\n\nSo, no matter how you measure it, while ChatGPT does not appear to have racial bias when judging engineers\u2019 profiles, it\u2019s not particularly good at the task either.\n\n## ChatGPT is biased against non-traditional candidates\n\nWhy did ChatGPT perform poorly on this task? Perhaps it\u2019s because there may not be that much signal in a resume in the first place. But there\u2019s another possible explanation as well.\n\nYears ago, I ran an experiment where I [anonymized a bunch of resumes and had recruiters try to guess which candidates were the good ones](https://interviewing.io/blog/resumes-suck-heres-the-data). They did terribly at this task, about as well as random guessing. Not surprisingly, they tended to over-index on resumes that had top companies or prestigious schools on them. In my data set of candidates, I happened to have a lot of non-traditional, good candidates \u2014 people who were strong engineers but didn\u2019t attend a highly ranked school or work at a top company. That threw recruiters for a loop.\n\nIt looks like the same thing happened to ChatGPT, at least in part. We went back and looked at how ChatGPT treated candidates with top-tier schools on their LinkedIn profiles vs. those without. It turns out that ChatGPT consistently overestimates the passing rate of engineers with top schools and top companies on their resumes. We also saw that ChatGPT consistently underestimates the performance of candidates without those elite \u201ccredentials\u201d on their resumes. Both of these differences are statistically significant. In the graph below, you can see exactly how much ChatGPT overestimates and underestimates in each case.\n\n![GPT-4's bias against non-traditional engineers](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fchatgpt_school_and_company_bias_818bd5dfc7.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nTo ChatGPT\u2019s credit, we did not find the same bias when it came to top companies, which is funny because, in our experience, having worked at a top company carries some predictive signal, whereas where someone went to school does not carry much.\n\n## ChatGPT likely isn't racist, but its biases still make it bad at recruiting\n\nIn recruiting, we often talk about unconscious bias. Though it\u2019s no longer en vogue, companies have historically spent tens of thousands of dollars on unconscious bias trainings designed to stop recruiters from making decisions based on candidates\u2019 gender and race. At the same time, recruiters were trained to exhibit a different, conscious bias: to actively select candidates from elite schools and top companies.\n\nThe same conscious bias against candidates who didn\u2019t attend a top-tier school appears to be codified in ChatGPT.\n\nThat decision is rational \u2014 in the absence of a better signal, you have to use proxies, and those proxies seem as good as any. Unfortunately, as you can see from these results (and from other studies we\u2019ve done in the past; see the footnote for the full list[5](#user-content-fn-5)), it\u2019s not particularly accurate\u2026 and it\u2019s definitely not accurate enough to codify into our AI tools.\n\nIn a market where [recruiter jobs are tenuous](https://interviewing.io/blog/when-is-hiring-coming-back-predictions-for-2024), where the [dwindling number of recruiters is dealing with more applicants than before](https://www.ashbyhq.com/talent-trends-report/reports/2023-recruiter-productivity-trends-report) and are pressured, more than ever, to make the aforementioned rapid decisions, and where companies are embracing AI as a tempting and productive cost-cutting measure[6](#user-content-fn-6), we\u2019re in rather dangerous territory.\n\nA few months ago, we published a long piece called, \u201c[Why AI can\u2019t do hiring](https://interviewing.io/blog/why-ai-cant-do-hiring)\u201d. The main two points of the piece were that 1) it\u2019s hard to extract signal from a resume because there\u2019s not much there in the first place, and 2) even if you could, you\u2019d need proprietary performance data to train an AI \u2014 without that data, you\u2019re doing glorified keyword matching.\n\nUnfortunately, most, if not all, of the AI tools and systems that claim to help recruiters make better decisions do not have this kind of data and are 1) either built on top of GPT (or one of its analogs) without fine-tuning or 2) are glorified keyword matchers masquerading as AI, or both.\n\nThough human recruiters aren\u2019t particularly good at judging resumes, and though we, as a society, don\u2019t yet have a great solution to the problem of effective candidate filtering, it\u2019s clear that off-the-shelf AI solutions are not the magic pill we\u2019re looking for \u2014 they\u2019re flawed in the same ways as humans. They just do the wrong thing faster and at scale.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. We used a Chi-squared goodness of fit test, a type of statistical significance test that you use for discrete data, like yes or no votes on resumes. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n2. Another way to see this is to simulate the same process with a perfectly unbiased resume sorter, i.e., a bot that picks from the 8 resumes at random. If you run 1,000 imaginary versions of the Bloomberg experiment, it\u2019s pretty common for a particular group to have a round where they\u2019re the top pick just 11% of the time. This distribution is in the histogram below. This is another way of saying what the p-values are saying: the disparities are consistent with random chance. [INSERT HISTOGRAM] [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-2)\n3. A caveat is that these tests might show evidence of bias if the sample size were increased to, say, 10,000 rather than 1,000. That is, with a larger sample size, the p-value might show that ChatGPT is indeed more biased than random chance. The thing is, we just don\u2019t know from their analysis, and it certainly rules out extreme bias. In fact, the [most recent large-scale resume audit study](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/137/4/1963/6605934) found that resumes with distinctively Black names were 2.1 percentage points less likely to get callbacks from human recruiters. Based on Bloomberg\u2019s data, ChatGPT\u2019s was less biased against resumes from Black candidates than human recruiters \u2014 according to our calculations, in the Bloomberg data set, there was 1.5 percentage point drop. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-3)\n4. Mock interview performance, especially in aggregate, is very predictive of real interview performance. We have data from both mock and real interviews, spanning ~6 years, and the candidates who\u2019ve done well in mock interviews on our platform have consistently been 3X more likely to pass real interviews. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-4)\n5. Here is a list of our past studies that show how top schools are not particularly predictive and top companies are only somewhat predictive:\n\n   - [Lessons from a year\u2019s worth of hiring data](https://interviewing.io/blog/lessons-from-a-years-worth-of-hiring-data)\n   - [We looked at how a thousand college students performed in technical interviews to see if where they went to school mattered.

A significant portion of employers, ranging from 35-55% depending on the source (Zippia, Forbes, USC), are currently using AI to screen job candidates. The adoption of AI in hiring appears to be particularly high among large enterprises and recruiting firms. Given that large enterprises see a disproportionately high volume of candidates, the % of candidates who are screened by AI is likely much higher than the 35-55% number.

Here's what we found.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: June 12, 2017; Last updated: July 14, 2023\n\n*Note: Though I wrote most of the words in this post, the legendary [Dave Holtz](https://twitter.com/daveholtz) did the heavy lifting on the data side. See more of his work on [his blog](https://www.daveholtz.net/).*\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this post, there\u2019s a decent chance that you\u2019re about to re-enter the crazy and scary world of technical interviewing. Maybe you\u2019re a college student or fresh grad who is going through the interviewing process for the first time. Maybe you\u2019re an experienced software engineer who hasn\u2019t even thought about interviews for a few years. Either way, the first step in the interviewing process is usually to read a bunch of online interview guides (especially if they\u2019re written by companies you\u2019re interested in) and to chat with friends about their experiences with the interviewing process (both as an interviewer and interviewee). More likely than not, what you read and learn in this first, \u201cexploratory\u201d phase of the interview process will inform how you choose to prepare moving forward.\n\nThere are a few issues with this typical approach to interview preparation:\n\n- Most interview guides are written from the perspective of one company. While Company A may really value efficient code, Company B may place more of an emphasis on high-level problem-solving skills. Unless your heart is set on Company A, you probably don\u2019t want to give too much weight to what they value.\n- People lie sometimes, even if they don\u2019t mean to. In writing, companies may say they\u2019re language agnostic, or that it\u2019s worthwhile to explain your thought process, even if the answer isn\u2019t quite right. However, it\u2019s not clear if this is actually how they act! We\u2019re not saying that tech companies are nefarious liars who are trying to mislead their applicant pool. We\u2019re just saying that sometimes implicit biases sneak in and people aren\u2019t even aware of them.\n- A lot of the \u201cfolk knowledge\u201d that you hear from friends and acquaintances may not be based in fact at all. A lot of people assume that short interviews spell doom. Similarly, everyone can recall one long interview after which they\u2019ve thought to themselves, \u201cI really hit it off with that interviewer, I\u2019ll definitely get passed onto the next stage.\u201d In the past, [we\u2019ve seen that people are really bad at gauging how they did in interviews](https://interviewing.io/blog/own-interview-performance). This time, we wanted to look directly at indicators like interview length and see if those actually matter.\n\n**Here at interviewing.io, we are uniquely positioned to approach technical interviews and their outcomes in a data-driven way. This time, we\u2019ve opted for a quick (if not dirty) and quantitative analysis. In other words, rather than digging deep into individual interviews, we focused on easily measurable attributes that many interviews share, like duration and language choice.** In upcoming posts, we\u2019ll be delving deeper into the interview content itself. If you\u2019re new to our blog and want to get some context about how interviewing.io works and what interview data we collect, please take a look at the section called \u201cThe setup\u201d below. Otherwise, please skip over that and head straight for the results!\n\n## The setup\n\n[interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/) is a platform where people can practice technical interviewing anonymously, and if things go well, unlock the ability to interview anonymously, whenever they\u2019d like, with top companies like Uber, Lyft, and Twitch. The cool thing is that both practice interviews and real interviews with companies take place within the interviewing.io ecosystem. As a result, we\u2019re able to collect quite a bit of interview data and analyze it to better understand technical interviews, the signal they carry, what works and what doesn\u2019t, and which aspects of an interview might actually matter for the outcome.\n\nEach interview, whether it\u2019s practice or real, starts with the interviewer and interviewee meeting in a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard, at which point they jump right into a technical question. Interview questions tend to fall into the category of what you\u2019d encounter in a phone screen for a back-end software engineering role. **During these interviews, we collect everything that happens, including audio transcripts, data and metadata describing the code that the interviewee wrote and tried to run, and detailed feedback from both the interviewer and interviewee about how they think the interview went and what they thought of each other.**\n\nIf you\u2019re curious, you can see what the feedback forms for interviewers and interviewees look like below \u2014 in addition to one direct yes/no question, we also ask about a few different aspects of interview performance using a 1-4 scale. We also ask interviewees some extra questions that we don\u2019t share with their interviewers, and one of the things we ask is whether an interviewee has previously seen the question they just worked on.\n\n![Screenshot of Interviewing.io interview feedback form for interviewers](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6ba25_new_interviewer_feedback_8fa7f982c6.webp&w=1200&q=75 \"Feedback form for interviewers\")\n\nFeedback form for interviewers\n\n![Screenshot of Interviewing.io interview feedback form for interviewees](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6702c_new_interviewee_feedback_3ae44bf112.webp&w=1200&q=75 \"Feedback form for interviewees\")\n\nFeedback form for interviewees\n\n## The results\n\nBefore getting into the thick of it, it\u2019s worth noting that the conclusions below are based on observational data, which means we can\u2019t make strong causal claims\u2026 but we can still share surprising relationships we\u2019ve observed and explain what we found so you can draw your own conclusions.\n\n### Having seen the interview question before\n\n*\u201cWe\u2019re talking about practice!\u201d* -Allen Iverson\n\nFirst thing\u2019s first. It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to suggest that one of the best ways to do better in interviews is to\u2026 practice interviewing. There are a number of resources out there to help you practice, ours among them. One of the main benefits of working through practice problems is that you reduce the likelihood of being asked to solve something you\u2019ve never seen before. Balancing that binary search tree will be much less intimidating if you\u2019ve already done it once or twice.\n\nWe looked at a sample of ~3000 interviews and compared the outcome to whether the interviewee had seen the interview question before. You can see the results in the plot below.\n\n**Unsurprisingly, interviewees who had seen the question were 16.6% more likely to be considered hirable by their interviewer.** This difference is statistically significant (p < 0.001).[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n\n### Does it matter what language you code in?\n\n*\u201cWhoever does not love the language of his birth is lower than a beast and a foul smelling fish.\u201d* -Jose Rizal\n\nYou might imagine that different languages lead to better interviews. For instance, maybe the readability of Python gives you a leg up in interviews. Or perhaps the fact that certain languages handle data structures in a particularly clean way makes common interview questions easier. We wanted to see whether or not there were statistically significant differences in interview performance across different interview languages.\n\nTo investigate, we grouped interviews on our platform by interview language and filtered out any languages that were used in fewer than 5 interviews (this only threw out a handful of interviews). After doing this, we were able to look at interview outcome and how it varied as a function of interview language.\n\nThe results of that analysis are in the chart below. Any non-overlapping confidence intervals represent a statistically significant difference in how likely an interviewee is to \u2018pass\u2019 an interview, as a function of interview language. Although we don\u2019t do a pairwise comparison for every possible pair of languages, the data below suggest that generally speaking, **there aren\u2019t statistically significant differences between the success rate when interviews are conducted in different languages**.[2](#user-content-fn-2)\n\nThat said, one of the most common mistakes we\u2019ve observed qualitatively is people choosing languages they\u2019re not comfortable in and then messing up basic stuff like array length lookup, iterating over an array, instantiating a hash table, and so on. This is especially mortifying when interviewees purposely pick a fancy-sounding language to impress their interviewer. Trust us, wielding your language of choice comfortably beats out showing off in a fancy-sounding language you don\u2019t know well, every time.\n\n### Even if language doesn\u2019t matter\u2026 is it advantageous to code in the company\u2019s language of choice?\n\n*\u201cGod help me, I\u2019ve gone native.\u201d* -Margaret Blaine\n\nIt\u2019s all well and good that, in general, interview language doesn\u2019t seem particularly correlated with performance. However, you might imagine that there could be an effect depending on the language that a given company uses. You could imagine a Ruby shop saying \u201cwe only hire Ruby developers, if you interview in Python we\u2019re less likely to hire you.\u201d On the flip side, you could imagine that a company that writes all of their code in Python is going to be much more critical of an interviewee in Python \u2013 they know the ins and outs of the language, and might judge the candidate for doing all sorts of \u201cnon-pythonic\u201d things during their interview.\n\nThe chart below is similar to the chart which showed differences in interview success rate (as measured by interviewers being willing to hire the interviewee) for [C++,](https://interviewing.io/cplusplus-interview-questions) [Java](https://interviewing.io/java-interview-questions), and [Python](https://interviewing.io/python-interview-questions). However, this chart also breaks out performance by whether or not the interview language is in the company\u2019s stack. We restrict this analysis to C++, Java and Python because these are the three languages where we had a good mixture of interviews where the company did and did not use that language. **The results here are mixed. When the interview language is Python or C++, there\u2019s no statistically significant difference between the success rates for interviews where the interview language is or is not a language in the company\u2019s stack. However, interviewers who interviewed in Java were more likely to succeed when interviewing with a Java shop (p=0.037).**\n\nSo, why is it that coding in the company\u2019s language seems to be helpful when it\u2019s Java, but *not* when it\u2019s Python or C++? One possible explanation is that the communities that exist around certain programming languages (such as Java) place a higher premium on previous experience with the language. Along these lines, it\u2019s also possible that interviewers from companies that use Java are more likely to ask questions that favor those with a pre-existing knowledge of Java\u2019s idiosyncrasies.\n\n### What about the relationship between what language you program in and how good of a communicator you\u2019re perceived to be?\n\n*\u201cTo handle a language skillfully is to practice a kind of evocative sorcery.\u201d* -Charles Baudelaire\n\nEven if language choice doesn\u2019t matter that much for overall performance (Java-wielding companies notwithstanding), we were curious whether different language choices led to different outcomes in other interview dimensions. For instance, an extremely readable language, like Python, may lead to interview candidates who are assessed to have communicated better. On the other hand, a low-level language like C++ might lead to higher scores for technical ability. Furthermore, very readable or low-level languages might lead to correlations between these two scores (for instance, maybe they\u2019re a C++ interview candidate who can\u2019t explain at all what he or she is doing but who writes very efficient code). The chart below suggests that there isn\u2019t really any observable difference between how candidates\u2019 technical and communication abilities are perceived, across a variety of programming languages.\n\n![Heatmaps showing communication ability vs. coding skill for different programming languages](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fcodistribution_1_72711c2cab.webp&w=1920&q=75 \"Communication ability vs. coding skill for different programming languages\")\n\n**Furthermore, no matter what, poor technical ability seems highly correlated with poor communication ability \u2013 regardless of language, it\u2019s relatively rare for candidates to perform well technically but not effectively communicate what they\u2019re doing (or vice versa)**, largely (and fortunately) debunking the myth of the incoherent, fast-talking, awkward engineer.[3](#user-content-fn-3)\n\n### Interview duration\n\n*\u201cIt\u2019s fine when you careen off disasters and terrifyingly bad reviews and rejection and all that stuff when you\u2019re young; your resilience is just terrific.\u201d* -Harold Prince\n\nWe\u2019ve all had the experience of leaving an interview and just feeling like it went poorly. Often, that feeling of certain underperformance is motivated by rules of thumb that we\u2019ve either come up with ourselves or heard repeated over and over again. You might find yourself thinking, \u201cthe interview didn\u2019t last long? That\u2019s probably a bad sign\u2026 \u201d or \u201cI barely wrote anything in that interview! I\u2019m definitely not going to pass.\u201d Using our data, we wanted to see whether these rules of thumb for evaluating your interview performance had any merit.\n\nFirst, we looked at the length of the interview. Does a shorter interviewer mean you were such a trainwreck that the interviewer just had to stop the interview early? Or was it maybe the case that the interviewer had less time than normal, or had seen in just a short amount of time that you were an awesome candidate? The plot below shows the distributions of interview length (measured in minutes) for both successful and unsuccessful candidates. **A quick look at this chart suggests that there is no difference in the distribution of interview lengths between interviews that go well and interviews that don\u2019t \u2014 the average length of interviews where the interviewer wanted to hire the candidate was 51.00 minutes, whereas the average length of interviews where the interviewer did not was 49.95 minutes. This difference is not statistically significant.**[4](#user-content-fn-4)\n\n### Amount of code written\n\n*\u201cBrevity is the soul of wit.\u201d* -William Shakespeare\n\nYou may have experienced an interview where you were totally stumped. The interviewer asks you a question you barely understand, you repeat back to him or her \u201cbinary search what?\u201d, and you basically write no code during your interview. You might hope that you could still pass an interview like this through sheer wit, charm, and high-level problem-solving skills. In order to assess whether or not this was true, we looked at the final character length of code written by the interviewee. The plot below shows the distributions of character length for both successful and unsuccessful. A quick look at this chart suggests that there is a difference between the two \u2014 interviews that don\u2019t go well tend to have less code. There are two phenomena that may contribute to this. First, unsuccessful interviewers may write less code to begin with. Additionally, they may be more prone to delete large swathes of code they\u2019ve written that either don\u2019t run or don\u2019t return the expected result.\n\n**On average, successful interviews had final interview code that was on average 2045 characters long, whereas unsuccessful ones were, on average, 1760 characters long.** That\u2019s a big difference! This finding is statistically significant and probably not very surprising.\n\n### Code modularity\n\n*\u201cThe mark of a mature programmer is willingness to throw out code you spent time on when you realize it\u2019s pointless.\u201d* -Bram Cohen\n\nIn addition to just look at *how much* code you write, we can also think about the type of code you write. Conventional wisdom suggests that good programmers don\u2019t recycle code \u2013 they write modular code that can be reused over and over again. We wanted to know if that type of behavior was actually rewarded during the interview process. In order to do so, we looked at interviews conducted in Python[5](#user-content-fn-5) and counted how many function definitions appeared in the final version of the interview. We wanted to know if successful interviewees defined more functions \u2014 while having more function handlers is not the definition of modularity, in our experience, it\u2019s a pretty strong signal of it. As always, it\u2019s impossible to make strong causal claims about this \u2013 it might be the case that certain interviewers (who are more or less lenient) ask interview questions that lend themselves to more or fewer functions. Nonetheless, it is an interesting trend to investigate!\n\nThe plot below shows the distribution of the number of Python functions defined for both candidates who the interviewer said they would hire and candidates who the interviewer said they would not hire. A quick look at this chart suggests that there *is* a difference in the distribution of function definitions between interviews that go well and interviews that don\u2019t. Successful interviewees seem to define *more* functions.\n\n**On average, successful candidates interviewing in Python define 3.29 functions, whereas unsuccessful candidates define 2.71 functions. This finding is statistically significant. The upshot here is that interviewers really do reward the kind of code they say they want you to write.**\n\n### Does it matter if your code runs?\n\n*\u201cMove fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.\u201d* -Mark Zuckerberg  \n*\u201cThe most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements.\u201d* -Brian Kernighan\n\nA common refrain in technical interviews is that interviewers don\u2019t actually care if your code runs \u2013 what they care about is problem-solving skills. Since we collect data on the code interviewees run and whether or not that code compiles, we wanted to see if there was evidence for this in our data. Is there any difference between the percentage of code that compiles error-free in successful interviews versus unsuccessful interviews? Furthermore, can interviewees actually still get hired, even if they make tons of syntax errors?\n\nIn order to get at this question, we looked at the data. We restricted our dataset to interviews longer than 10 minutes with more than 5 unique instances of code being executed. This helped filter out interviews where interviewers didn\u2019t actually want the interviewee to run code, or where the interview was cut short for some reason. We then measured the percent of code runs that resulted in errors.[6](#user-content-fn-6) Of course, there are some limitations to this approach \u2013 for instance, candidates could execute code that does compile but gives a slightly incorrect answer. They could also get the right answer and write it to stderr! Nonetheless, this should give us a directional sense of whether or not there\u2019s a difference.\n\nThe chart below gives a summary of this data. The x-axis shows the percentage of code executions that were error-free in a given interview. So an interview with 3 code executions and 1 error message would count towards the \u201c30%-40%\u201d bucket. The y-axis indicates the percentage of all interviews that fall in that bucket, for both successful and unsuccessful interviews. Just eyeballing the chart below, one gets the sense that on average, successful candidates run more code that goes off without an error. But is this difference statistically significant?\n\nOn average, successful candidates\u2019 code ran successfully (didn\u2019t result in errors) 64% of the time, whereas unsuccessful candidates\u2019 attempts to compile code ran successfully 60% of the time, and this difference was indeed significant. **Again, while we can\u2019t make any causal claims, the main takeaway is that successful candidates do usually write code that runs better, despite what interviewers may tell you at the outset of an interview.**\n\n### Should you wait and gather your thoughts before writing code?\n\n*\u201cNever forget the power of silence, that massively disconcerting pause which goes on and on and may at last induce an opponent to babble and backtrack nervously.\u201d* -Lance Morrow\n\nWe were also curious whether or not successful interviewees tended to take their time in the interview. Interview questions are often complex! After being presented with a question, there might be some benefit to taking a step back and coming up with a plan, rather than jumping right into things. In order to get a sense of whether or not this was true, we measured how far into a given interview candidates first executed code. Below is a histogram showing how far into interviews both successful and unsuccessful interviewees first ran code. Looking quickly at the histogram, you can tell that successful candidates do in fact wait a bit longer to start running code, although the magnitude of the effect isn\u2019t huge.\n\nMore specifically, **on average, candidates with successful interviews first run code 27% of the way through the interview, whereas candidates with unsuccessful interviews first run code 23.9% of the way into the interview, and this difference is significant**. Of course, there are alternate explanations for what\u2019s happening here. For instance, perhaps successful candidates are better at taking the time to sweet-talk their interviewer. Furthermore, the usual caveat that we can\u2019t make causal claims applies \u2013 if you just sit in an interview for an extra 5 minutes in complete silence, it won\u2019t help your chances. Nonetheless, there does seem to be a difference between the two cohorts.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nAll in all, this post was our first attempt to understand what does and does not typically lead to an interviewer saying \u201cyou know what, I\u2019d really like to hire this person.\u201d Because all of our data are observational, its hard to make causal claims about what we see. While successful interviewees may exhibit certain behaviors, adopting those behaviors doesn\u2019t guarantee success. Nonetheless, it does allow us to support (or call bullshit on) a lot of the advice you\u2019ll read on the internet about how to be a successful interviewee.\n\nThat said, there is much still to be done. This was a first, quantitative pass over our data (which is, in many ways, a treasure trove of interview secrets), but we\u2019re excited to do a deeper, qualitative dive and actually start to categorize different questions to see which carry the most signal as well as really get our head around 2nd order behaviors that you can\u2019t measure easily by running a regex over a code sample or measuring how long an interview took.

Engineers use us for mock interviews, and we use the data from those interviews to surface top performers, in a much fairer and more predictive way than a resume. If you\u2019re a top performer on interviewing.io, we fast-track you at the world\u2019s best companies.\n\nWe\u2019re venture backed and have raised 4 rounds of funding in the last 7 years, totaling over $15M, which means that I\u2019ve done a lot of VC pitches. I don\u2019t know how many exactly (and a lady should never tell), but it\u2019s in the hundreds. Once you\u2019ve done that many pitches, you start to hear the same feedback over and over. They range from questions about whether the eng hiring is big enough (it is) to how objections about human-on-human interviews don\u2019t scale (if 2 humans doing a thing together didn\u2019t scale, our species would be extinct) to polite suggestions about how we\u2019d be a much more attractive investment if we used ML/AI to match candidates to companies.\n\nI\u2019ve heard the latter a LOT over the years, but despite the well-intentioned advice, I\u2019m convinced that building an AI matcher is a fool\u2019s errand. My argument is this: **It\u2019s not that AI doing hiring is technically impossible \u2013 ChatGPT has shown us that the ceiling on what\u2019s possible is higher than many of us had ever imagined \u2013 but that it\u2019s impossible because you don\u2019t have the data.** In other words, the hard part about hiring isn\u2019t the tech. It\u2019s having the data to make good hiring decisions in the first place.\n\n**For the purposes of this piece, I define \u201chiring\u201d as being able to find candidates for specific roles and fill those roles. I am NOT referring to automating tasks like resume parsing, writing sourcing emails, or scheduling, i.e., tasks that human recruiters, sourcers, and coordinators do as part of their job. Surely those can be automated. The more interesting question is whether an AI can do the job of a recruiter better than a human.[1](#user-content-fn-1)** In other words, can it take a list of candidates, a list of job descriptions, and then use publicly available (NOT proprietary) data to match them up successfully and fill roles? After all, the reality is that neither recruiters nor burgeoning AI recruiting startups have a proprietary data set to work with. They usually have job descriptions, LinkedIn Recruiter (the granular search functionality of which isn\u2019t publicly accessible\u2026 but the LinkedIn profiles of candidates actually are), and whatever else they can find on the internet.\n\nTo wit, this post isn\u2019t about how AI can\u2019t be used for hiring if you have all the data. Rather, it\u2019s about how you can\u2019t get access to all the data you\u2019d need to do hiring, thereby making the training of an AI impossible.\n\nThis post also isn't about how human are great at hiring. There's nothing special about our humanity when it comes to recruiting, and humans actually suck at hiring for the same reasons as AI \u2014 we don't have the data either.\n\n## A few caveats: the case for Microsoft and the question of bias\n\nAt this point, you\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cWell, surely Microsoft can do this, given that they own both LinkedIn and GitHub.\u201d In this post, you\u2019ll see why LinkedIn and GitHub are not enough. Perhaps if Microsoft chose to buy a bunch of applicant tracking systems (ATSs) in order to get access to interview performance data, coupled with data from LinkedIn and GitHub, they\u2019d have a fighting chance, but honestly that\u2019s probably not enough either.\n\nMoreover, the tenuous Microsoft edge aside, the reality is that most of us do NOT have access to the kind of training data we\u2019d need, but we still see startup after startup claiming to do AI hiring in their marketing materials.\n\nFinally, before we get into why AI can\u2019t do hiring, I want to call out the important question of bias that results from training AI on hiring data where decisions were previously made by humans. To keep this (already long) post on task, I will not touch on the subject of the bias. To be sure, it\u2019s a real problem, and there\u2019s already a lot of good writing on the subject.\n\nThat caveat aside, if we\u2019re trying to build a solution that takes candidates and jobs as inputs and produces a set of matches as output, let\u2019s start by considering what that matcher does and how it\u2019s trained.\n\n## How do we train an AI matcher?\n\nLet\u2019s pretend for a moment that we have built the platonic ideal of an AI matcher. It takes 2 inputs: a list of candidates and a list of companies, and a sorted list of company/role matches come out, like so:\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/AI_matcher_d024945e8d.png)\n\nTo train this matcher, we need 3 distinct pieces of data:\n\n1. Publicly available job descriptions from a bunch of tech companies\n2. Publicly available data about engineers, i.e., LinkedIn profiles, GitHub profiles & contributions, and engineers\u2019 social graph across a bunch of different platforms\n3. A list of successful company/candidate matches, taken from the public domain, e.g., from scraping LinkedIn to see where people worked/for how long, and cross-referencing that with (1) and (2).\n\nYou may notice that in all 3 data requirements above, I called out that they\u2019re publicly available. That might seem odd at first \u2014 after all, if you\u2019re starting a company that\u2019s building this matcher, your secret sauce might be your proprietary data about candidates or companies or both, and you might first run a different business model, completely divorced from AI, to collect this data, at which point, boom, you flip a switch, and all of a sudden you\u2019re an AI company.\n\nThat\u2019s a good strategy, but it\u2019s actually really hard to acquire detailed, proprietary data about candidates, companies, or how well people do at companies once they\u2019re hired, let alone all 3 at once. Most startups that try to build an AI matcher don\u2019t start with a bunch of proprietary data. Rather, they start with the public domain. The thesis of this piece is that getting the data is the hard part, not the AI, so to reason through it, let\u2019s assume that we have the AI already but that the only data we have is publicly available.\n\nSo now that we have all this training data, let\u2019s get to work. We\u2019ll go through the set of successful matches and then find more data about those candidates and those companies and see which traits carry the most signal for a good match.\n\nWe now have a trained and working matcher. So far so good. But wait, not so fast!\n\n## What is hiring, really?\n\nLet\u2019s switch gears and forget about our matcher for a moment. Broadly speaking, regardless of how we get there, what needs to be true for someone to be a good fit for a job? There are three things:\n\n1. *Good*: They\u2019re good enough to do the job\n2. *Looking*: They\u2019re open to taking a new job\n3. *Interested*: They\u2019re interested in the job/company\n\n**Let\u2019s succinctly call those \u201cgood, looking, and interested\u201d. These three criteria are necessary to make a hire.**\n\nThe first two items are largely independent of the company. The third is about candidate/company fit, and we\u2019ll come back to it when we talk about matching. Before we do that, though, can we actually deduce which engineers are good and looking?\n\nI would argue that we can\u2019t. No matter how the matcher ended up getting trained or what patterns or artifacts it detected and assigned value to, the data to tell whether someone is a good engineer (even if the definition is elastic, depending on a given company\u2019s \u201cbar\u201d) simply does not exist in the public domain.\\*\\* An AI is very good at finding patterns in existing data. It is not good at magicking data out of thin air. That means that before we even get to the question of matching, we\u2019re dead in the water.\\*\\* Let me try to convince you.\n\n### \u201cGood\u201d\n\nGenerally, you have 3 pieces of public data available to you for a given engineer:\n\n1. Their public-facing LinkedIn\n2. Their public-facing GitHub\n3. Their public-facing social graph\n\nSurely you can tell if someone is a good engineer from some combo of these 3?\n\n### LinkedIn\n\nLet\u2019s look at each of the 3 data sources above, starting with LinkedIn. What data is available on engineers\u2019 public-facing LinkedIns? Given that a LinkedIn profile is a glorified resume, it\u2019s usually these 3 things:\n\n1. Where they\u2019ve previously worked\n2. Where they went to school\n3. Any certifications/endorsements/skills that they have\n\nI run a hiring marketplace, and having any kind of edge in predicting which of our users are good is material to our business, so we\u2019ve spent a good amount of time and effort trying to tie these attributes to how good an engineer is. As it turns out, an engineer\u2019s employment history carries some signal, school carries very little to none, and LinkedIn [certifications](https://interviewing.io/blog/why-you-shouldnt-list-certifications-on-linkedIn) and [endorsements](https://interviewing.io/blog/linkedin-endorsements-useless) carry a negative signal.[2](#user-content-fn-2)\n\nKnowing which programming languages or frameworks an engineer knows can be useful, but most eng roles are either language/framework agnostic OR the language/framework is not the most significant bit when determining whether an engineer is a good fit or not \u2014 knowing the language is usually a nice to have, but it won\u2019t get you hired if you\u2019re not a good coder, first and foremost.\n\nOften, in the absence of being able to search for whether an engineer is good, recruiters will search for programming languages as a proxy for fit, but that\u2019s all it is, a weak proxy.\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/linkedin_filter_c6d9fc88df.png)\n\nBasically, if you\u2019re relying on a combo of school, work history, and specific skills, you\u2019re doing exactly the same work that armies of recruiters have been doing for decades, with very limited success. It\u2019s really easy to search LinkedIn for past employers, schools, and skills/endorsements. They\u2019ve built a whole business on it. However, humans are terrible at predicting engineer quality from resumes \u2014 [only about as good as a coinflip](https://interviewing.io/blog/resumes-suck-heres-the-data). **And it\u2019s not because humans are bad and that an AI would do better. It\u2019s because there\u2019s minimal signal in a resume in the first place, and try hard as you might, extracting signal in this case is like squeezing water from a stone. Having a robot hand will not save you.**\n\nAI or not, we\u2019re in a hard market. Keep your skills sharp. Sign up for anonymous mock interviews with engineers from top companies.\n\n[See available times](https://interviewing.io/signup)\n\n![](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcta.47351a0d.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\n### GitHub\n\nGitHub is an interesting one. Surely if you have access to a bunch of code someone has written, you can suss out if they\u2019re a good engineer. The GitHub approach is also appealing because it\u2019s much more meritocratic than a resume \u2014 your good code can stand on its own, regardless of who you are or where you come from. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if GitHub could help you surface the odd diamond in the rough or an upstart with no job experience?\n\nThis is of course, the ethical question of whether GitHub should be used for hiring in the first place and whether it\u2019s fair to create a bias toward hobbyist engineers and/or open-source contributors.[3](#user-content-fn-3) For the purposes of this piece, I will put aside that question and focus just on whether GitHub *can* be used for hiring.\n\nThe short answer is that it can\u2019t because most engineers don\u2019t have public commits. Senior engineers at large tech companies don\u2019t work on open-source projects for the most part. This is why [programmers on Reddit laugh](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/11g13i6/he_is_not_qualified) at the idea of screening out candidates with unused GitHub accounts. Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor of C++, would look unimpressive to an algorithm obsessed with GitHub activity.\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bjarne_68a4633cd6.png)\n\nThis same message is clear from data on GitHub\u2019s users. The website [reported 100 million active developers in early 2023](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/26/github-says-it-now-has-100m-active-users), but data on all commits in 2022 shows that only about 11 million users had any public code commits and only 8 million had more than two commits. That means that only 8-10% of engineers actually have publicly available GitHub data that our AI could use, in the absolute best case, and this counts millions of repositories with names like \u201chello world\u201d and \u201ctest.\u201d\n\nBen Frederickson did some of his digging about the utility of GitHub in hiring and published a [stellar, highly detailed report](https://www.benfrederickson.com/github-wont-help-with-hiring) in 2018. According to Frederickson, only 1.4% of GitHub users pushed more than 100 times, and only 0.15% of GitHub users pushed more than 500 times. Frederickson\u2019s findings from 2018 roughly corroborate ours from late 2022, and in both cases, there is a clear power law \u2013 most of the commits are being done by a tiny fraction of GitHub\u2019s users.\n\nA paper called \u201c[The Promises and Perils of Mining GitHub](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2597073.2597074)\u201d, published in 2014, looked at GitHub activity as well, through the lens of projects rather than users. They found a similar power-law relationship \u2013 the most active 2.5% of projects account for the same number of commits as the remaining 97.5% projects. Moreover, this paper found that about 37% of projects on GitHub were not being used for software development, and the rest were used for other purposes (e.g., storage).\n\n**Given these limitations, the reality is that the portion of GitHub accounts that could actually be useful for hiring is likely under 1%.**\n\n### Social Graph\n\nFinally, we have the social graph. The hypothesis here is that great engineers follow other great engineers on platforms like GitHub and Twitter, so if we can identify a set of great engineers somehow, and dig deeply enough through the tangled web of whom they follow and who follows them, we\u2019ll be able to create a reliable talent map.\n\nLet\u2019s assume for a moment that we can seed this approach with enough great engineers (e.g., by scraping the GitHub profiles that do have enough code to extract signal). What happens next?\n\nTo get a feel for the \u201cfollowing\u201d behavior among software engineers and whether they tend to follow the best people they work with, we surveyed our user base, like so:\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/social_network_survey_3a890590ac.png)\n\nBased on almost 1000 responses from our engineers (average years of experience = 8, median = 7), the social graph approach doesn\u2019t hold water. First, engineers that we surveyed only rarely followed their most impressive colleagues on GitHub or Twitter. **The average engineer reported following just one of their top five coworkers in these sites.** The social graph was just not that connected to people\u2019s perceptions of talent.\n\nWhat about Linkedin? \\*\\*Although many of our users did indeed follow the best engineers they\u2019ve ever worked with, they also followed everyone else: the majority of engineers we surveyed reported that their connections had no rhyme or reason, or they just connected with anyone who tried to connect with them. \\*\\*\n\nThese muddle the graph-based approaches. Twitter and GitHub follows are still too uncommon to be a reliable signal. And LinkedIn connections capture a haphazard mix of networking approaches \u2014 the most dominant of which is either random or just driven by workplace, which any recruiter would have known in the first place.\n\n### \u201cLooking\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s assume for a moment we can figure out who the good engineers are (or rate them on some kind of scale, at least). Next, we have to figure out which of these engineers are on the market right now.\n\nThis is arguably an easier problem to solve than whether an engineer is good because publicly available cues do exist. That said, a number of startups have tried to tackle this problem (most notably [Entelo, with their Sonar product](https://www.recruiter.com/recruiting/new-entelo-technology-lets-recruiters-know-which-employees-will-most-likely-quit)), though so far none have been particularly successful. The kinds of inputs that typically go into trying to figure out if an engineer is active are split between candidate-level attributes (e.g., how recently they updated their LinkedIn) and company-level attributes (e.g., how long since the company\u2019s last round of funding). Here\u2019s what that list could look like:\n\nCandidate-level attributes:\n\n- When did they last update their LinkedIn/have they recently started being more active on LinkedIn?\n- How long have they been in their current role? And at their current company?\n- Have they recently started being more active on social media (e.g., tweeting about engineering topics)?\n- Have they recently started a blog?\n- Have they recently started contributing to open source?\n\nCompany-level attributes:\n\n- How long has it been since the company last raised money (if not public)?\n- How has the stock price been doing (if public)?\n- Have other people been leaving the company, especially management?\n\nSome of these attributes are easier to pull than others (e.g., to track LinkedIn updates, one has to be logged in and has to repeatedly cache candidate activity, which likely violates LinkedIn\u2019s terms of service), but I imagine that there\u2019s enough publicly accessible data to make some guesses about who\u2019s moving. Of course, these guesses will be fairly primitive for candidates who don\u2019t do stuff publicly and loudly \u2014 going just off of stock price and/or fundraising history gives you a very crude first pass, but it\u2019s not enough.\n\nWhen asked their favorite social media platforms, half of engineers in a [StackOverflow survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019) reported Reddit or YouTube \u2014 which it\u2019s hard to imagine could ever be leveraged for predictive algorithms \u2014 or not using social media at all.\n\nAs such, even if this data is easier to get than candidate quality data, figuring out who\u2019s looking is still a data problem and not an AI tech problem.\n\n## Matching: Figuring out what engineers want and whether companies have it\n\nLet\u2019s say that we\u2019re somehow able to surmise from public-facing candidate data whether and engineer is both \u201cgood\u201d and \u201clooking\u201d. Now we need to figure out whether they\u2019re actually going to be interested in a given company.\n\nTo do that, we need to have a list of company attributes that engineers could care about, and then we need to figure out 1) how each company stacks up against this list and 2) which attributes a given engineer cares about. I\u2019ve been a recruiter for about a decade, and below is a decently representative list (in no particular order):\n\n- Compensation\n- Company mission/whether the company is mission-driven\n- Vertical\n- Size of whole team and the eng team\n- Tech stack\n- Young vs. established\n- Prestige of the brand/social proof\n- What problems are being solved/what\u2019s coming up on the roadmap\n- Chemistry with manager and with the immediate team\n- The company\u2019s culture and values\n\nNow that we have this list, how do we figure out how each company stacks up? Without a proprietary data set, the main resource you have is a company\u2019s job descriptions. How much of this information can you pull from those descriptions?\n\n### Figuring out what companies have to offer\n\nCompensation is increasingly easier to get, especially given recent legislation in some states that makes it mandatory for employers to include salary ranges in their job descriptions. Of course, these ranges tend to be wide, and many aren\u2019t super useful (see the examples below), but it\u2019s something. The screenshot below comes from [comprehensive.io](https://comprehensive.io), a site that aggregates comp ranges from job descriptions in NY and California, where companies are legally required to disclose them. As you can see, the ranges are quite wide.\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/comprehensive_io_comp_ranges_8b165c53d3.png)\n\nBelow is an example for a specific company and role: Dropbox\u2019s open Mobile Software Engineer role in the US. As you can see, the ranges are pretty wide (a 66K spread for SF, NYC, and Seattle for instance). In my mind, like many of these ranges, all this tells you is \u201cyou\u2019re going to get paid market for the location that you\u2019re in\u201d. Of course, if a company is paying below market, that\u2019s something you need to know, but that\u2019s the exception rather than the rule.\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dropbox_comp_0c43fb6d38.png)\n\nSome attributes like vertical, tech stack, total size, and brand prestige, are more consistent than compensation and are possible to figure out from publicly available data.\n\nWhether the company is mission-driven can sometimes be deduced from the vertical, the company\u2019s B-corp status, and the company\u2019s job descriptions. However, given every company\u2019s penchant for sounding mission-driven, even when they do something as dryly mercenary as ad-serving infrastructure, this may be a bit tricky. But I\u2019m sure the tech is there to figure this one out.\n\nProperties like eng team size, upcoming projects and roadmap, and the company\u2019s culture/values are much harder. Sussing these out is not a technological problem but rather a data one, just like determining whether engineers are good or not. Don\u2019t believe me? Read any job description. How do you begin to figure out from this wall of mush what it\u2019s actually like to work at a company? Maybe some great job descriptions exist out there, and maybe you can get somewhere by scraping sites like Glassdoor, but given how low-signal both tend to be, AI will likely get just as hamstrung as the humans trying to parse these documents.\n\nIf you don\u2019t buy that, check out [keyvalues.io](http://keyvalues.io) and look for literally any company. You\u2019ll notice that every company seems to have pulled randomly from the same-grab bag of 20 or so lofty-sounding values that tell you nothing about what actually happens at that company day to day. Instead, you find yourself smack in the middle of a vague virtue signaling arms race.\n\nSo, some of these attributes you can figure out from the public domain, and some you can\u2019t. In a nutshell, the data available to you on both sides looks like this:\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/candidates_and_companies_53617907f9.png)\n\nNow we have to tackle the second part of the matching problem: how do we figure out what each engineer on our list is looking for? For instance, which engineers in our database care about compensation, and what are their salary requirements? And what types of problems are they most interested in? And so on\u2026\n\nThe reality is that there isn\u2019t a good way to intuit most of these things from publicly available data. If you want to know what engineers care about, you have to ask them. And even when you ask them, they will very likely, albeit through no fault of their own, be lying.\n\n## Figuring out what engineers value and what they\u2019re looking for\n\nBecause, to the best of my knowledge, there isn\u2019t a dataset out there that compares and contrasts what engineers said they were looking for versus what jobs they ended up taking, I\u2019ll fall back to an anecdote from earlier in my recruiting career. TL;DR Dr. House was right; everybody lies.\n\nMany years ago, I was interim head of talent at Udacity. Many of my candidates told me that it was their dream to work in ed-tech, but one in particular stood out. In addition to extolling his passion about education, he told me that one of his deal-breakers was working in advertising and that he'd never do it. He did great in our first-round technical screen, and I set him up with an onsite interview. Then, while he was in town, he interviewed at an advertising startup where one of his friends was working. That's the place he ended up choosing\u2026 because he really hit it off with the team. Though this particular example was the most stark (the one-letter difference between \u201cad-tech\u201d and \u201ced-tech\u201d belies the massive gulf between those verticals), instances like this, where a candidate claimed to strongly want one thing but then ended up choosing something completely different after meeting the team, are the rule rather than the exception.\n\nThe truth is, people will tell you all manner of lies about where they want to work, what they want to work on, and what's important to them. But, of course, they're not lying deliberately. It likely means you're not asking the right questions, but sometimes knowing what to ask is really hard. For many of the questions you can think of, people will have all sorts of rehearsed answers about what they want to do, but those answers are framed to the specific audience and may not reflect reality at all. Or, a lot of the time, people simply don't know what they want until they see it.\n\nIt\u2019s hard enough sussing this stuff out when you\u2019re talking to candidates 1:1. Imagine trying to gather this kind of nuanced information from what they say on social media or in their public blogs.\n\nPerhaps the most important thing I've learned is that, at the end of the day, one of the biggest parts of a recruiter's job is to get the right two people in a room together. Regardless of industry, or domain, or stack, or money (within reason of course), chemistry is king. Get the right two people to have the right conversation, and everything else goes out the window. Everybody lies. It\u2019s not malicious. It\u2019s just that chemistry is the thing that matters most, and all the rest of the attributes above are poor proxies for the magic that sometimes happens when two smart people have a good conversation.\n\nHow do you predict chemistry between people? Can an AI do it? Possibly, if that AI has access to a ton of data about candidates and companies, i.e., everything we\u2019ve discussed in this post thus far\u2026 AND past candidate/company interactions and their outcomes.\n\nEven if you can\u2019t get all the candidate and company data you\u2019d need, you CAN get a history of candidate/company interactions and their outcomes from an Applicant Tracking System (ATS). But ATS data is not public. It\u2019s the opposite \u2014 for ATSs, their data is their moat, which is what drives retention, and ATS switching costs are painful and often prohibitive.\n\nIn the absence of rich candidate and company data and the interactions between them, an AI predicting chemistry is impossible. Hell, humans can\u2019t do it either.\n\n## But what if you do have the data?\n\nIf you have proprietary data, then you don\u2019t need an AI. A simple non-AI program (e.g., a regression) or a human can do the job well enough. In fact, Arvind Narayan from Princeton gave an excellent talk called \u201c[How to recognize AI snake oil](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/talks/MIT-STS-AI-snakeoil.pdf)\u201d, whose crux is that, for complex questions where you need to predict social outcomes (e.g., recidivism, job performance), *no matter how much data you have*, because \u201cAI is not substantially better than manual scoring using just a few features\u201d.\n\nArguably, if you do have the data, you could still build out AI hiring to increase efficiency, but remember that it\u2019s your possession of proprietary data that made an AI approach viable.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo what does this all mean for the future of recruiting? As I said in the beginning, AI is really well-suited to automating a bunch of recruiting tasks that humans do now. For instance, an AI can take the pain out of stuff like this:\n\n- Interview scheduling\n- Composing first-draft sourcing emails (though you\u2019d need a human to truly make them sing)\n- Enriching candidate profiles with \u201cfirst-order\u201d data (years of experience, location, figuring out what programming languages they\u2019ve used in some cases, etc.)\n- Tracking candidate progress through a funnel\n- Some amount of assessment[4](#user-content-fn-4)\n- Creating beautiful dashboards that track key recruiting metrics (time to hire, cost per hire, etc.)\n\nAs AI gets more and more sophisticated, the list above will get longer and longer, and given that most recruiters aren\u2019t particularly good at their jobs, over time, AI will take over more and more, and there will be progressively less for human recruiters to do.\n\nHowever, the stuff above isn\u2019t what makes recruiting hard; these are the trappings of recruiting, but not the essence. The hard thing about recruiting is figuring out who\u2019s good and who\u2019s looking right now, and bulldozing the way for those candidates to have as many conversations with companies as they have appetite for, in order to see if they have chemistry with that company and potentially their future team.\n\nUntil we have access to all the data that reliably predicts whether someone is a good engineer, whether they\u2019re looking right now, and what a company offers, and whether they\u2019re interested in that thing, having an AI will not be enough.\n\n**At the end of the day, you can\u2019t use AI for hiring if you don\u2019t have the data. And if you have the data, then you don\u2019t strictly need AI.**\n\nAnd finally, because we don't have the data, humans will also continue to be bad at hiring. The difference is that good human recruiters can make some meaningful warm intros, let 2 engineers get in a room together to see if there's chemistry, and get the hell out of the way.\n\n*Huge thank you to Maxim Massenkoff, who did the data analysis for this post. Also thank you to everyone who read drafts of this behemoth and gave their feedback.*\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. If I were you, I\u2019d be justifiably skeptical at this point. Wow, a recruiter is writing about how AI can\u2019t do recruiting. Classic Luddite trope, right? Let\u2019s burn down the shoe factory because it can never compete with the artisanal shoes we make in our homes. In this case, though, you\u2019d be wrong. I walked away from a very lucrative recruiting agency that I built to start interviewing.io, precisely because I wanted to be the guy who owned the shoe factory, not the guy setting it on fire out of spite. Recruiting needs to change, it needs disintermediation, and it needs more data. It\u2019s the only way hiring will ever become efficient and fair. I just don\u2019t think AI is going to be that change. If I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019ll be the first in line to pivot interviewing.io to an AI-first solution. It\u2019s also worth calling out that in this piece, I focus specifically on hiring engineers, as my whole career and all of interviewing.io is dedicated exclusively to technical recruiting, but I expect that my reasoning holds for many other verticals. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n2. In all my years of trying to figure this out, the thing that carried the most signal is [how many typos engineers had on their resume](https://interviewing.io/blog/lessons-from-a-years-worth-of-hiring-data), which I think highlights the absurdity of this whole undertaking. See [this post](https://interviewing.io/blog/lessons-from-3000-technical-interviews) and [this post](https://interviewing.io/blog/we-looked-at-how-a-thousand-college-students-performed-in-technical-interviews-to-see-if-where-they-went-to-school-mattered-it-didnt) for previous data/discussion about the relative importance of employment history and pedigree in hiring. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-2)\n3. See [this piece by Ashe Dryden for some good discussion about the ethics of open source labor](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community). [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-3)\n4. You might be wondering at this point why I didn\u2019t list assessments here. Arguably, AI will be able to do some amount of assessment, probably somewhere between a HackerRank/Codility and a real human interviewer. I wrote many years ago about how [recruiting engineers is fundamentally a sourcing rather than a vetting problem](https://blog.alinelerner.com/building-a-product-in-the-technical-recruiting-space-read-this-first/), so I\u2019m very skeptical that AI-based assessments are meaningfully going to change the game \u2013 in order for assessments to be effective, engineers have to be willing to do them, which means there has to be value for both sides. This is why senior engineers typically balk at asynchronous coding tests, and the biggest attrition rates are usually at that part of the funnel. The future of technical assessments, in the age of generative AI is a noble and difficult topic, though, and it\u2019s something we\u2019ll tackle in a future post.

We dug into the data to find out.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: October 12, 2022; Last updated: December 7, 2024\n\nOver the past few months, I\u2019ve seen a number of fear-mongering pieces in the press about how the recession is driving tech layoffs and how tech employees (and engineers specifically) are losing their leverage as a result. Here are a few recent examples:\n\n- [The balance of power is shifting in the tech industry](https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/tech/tech-layoffs-workers-silicon-valley/index.html) (CNN)\n- [The hot market for tech employees is ending, giving the power back to companies like Meta and Google to set and reduce pay](https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-layoffs-salary-cuts-workers-2022-8) (Business Insider)\n- [Snap\u2019s Web3 team among 20% workforce reduction after first single-digit-growth quarter since going public](https://fortune.com/crypto/2022/09/01/snap-shutters-web3-team-layoffs-tech-evan-spiegel/) (Fortune)\n\nArticles like these drive engineers to speculate [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/um58oq/have_any_engineers_been_affected_by_recent_layoffs/), in the internet equivalent of hushed whispers, about whether they\u2019re next. Unfortunately, none of the pieces I\u2019ve seen have bothered to draw a distinction between \u201ctech\u201d and \u201csoftware engineering,\u201d and many even use these terms interchangeably (like the CNN piece above).\n\nThe problem is that \u201ctech\u201d can mean anyone working at a tech company. You\u2019re an engineer? Of course, you\u2019re tech. You do ops? Great, you\u2019re tech. You do marketing? You, too, are tech! These are all critical roles, and what I take umbrage with isn\u2019t the decision to label non-engineers as tech employees. It\u2019s deliberately misleading your audience by implying that \u201ctech\u201d refers to engineers specifically.\n\nI don\u2019t like imprecision, and I *really* don\u2019t like fear-mongering. So, we at interviewing.io decided to dig into the data to see if engineers do indeed have a reason to fear. The TL;DR is that while, yes, tech layoffs have affected engineers somewhat, they are one of the least affected departments. While the existence of layoffs, in concert with eng hiring slowing down in general, does mean that engineers are losing some leverage in the market, it\u2019s nowhere near as dire as the press makes it out to be.\n\n## The best source for layoff data\n\nAt some point in the last 2.5 years, you\u2019ve probably visited layoffs.fyi. It was launched by [Roger Lee](https://www.rogerlee.com/) in February 2020, just when concerns that this COVID-19 thing *might* affect the economy went mainstream. The site does exactly what it sounds like \u2013 it tracks layoffs at tech companies. Every time a company conducts a public round of layoffs, it gets added to a growing list. Each entry includes a layoff count, and a small subset of entries include a list of actual people who were let go, as well as some info about them (name, LinkedIn, geography, title, and so on). These layoff lists are usually in a Google doc but sometimes in something more fancy, like this [dedicated website for Shopify layoffs](https://weworkedatshop.com).\n\n![Table of companies and number of people laid off](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FLayoff_lists_on_layoffs_fyi_1_2ad6abbed9.png&w=1920&q=75 \"# of people laid off by company\")\n\nAs far as I know, even with its limitations, layoffs.fyi is the best source for layoff data, and because the individual layoff lists actually break out layoffs by function, it\u2019s the natural place to go if you want to disambiguate \u201ctech\u201d into specific departments.\n\nSo that\u2019s where we looked. Before we talk about what we did, I\u2019d like to call out one big limitation of the layoff lists on layoffs.fyi.\n\n## One big limitation of the data: layoff lists are opt-in\n\nFrom what we can tell, the layoff lists on layoffs.fyi are opt-in. In other words, former employees decide if they want to be included. Sometimes the difference between the layoff count reported in the press and the length of the list is substantial. Peloton, for instance, had 2800 layoffs, but their list only had 400 people.\n\nIf job losers\u2019 willingness to opt in depends on their role, they might be overrepresented in the layoff data. Recruiters, for instance, might be more willing to sign on since they know the value of getting their names out there. Our fix is to calculate opt-in rates for each role and use these as weights in the analysis \u2013 just like when the Census upweights groups who are less likely to respond to a survey. For more detail on how we did that, please see the section called \u201cAppendix: Methods\u201d below.\n\n## The questions we wanted to answer\n\nTo disambiguate \u201ctech layoffs\u201d into actual departments and break out how each department was affected, we needed to answer the following questions:\n\n1. **What % of employees got laid off overall?**\n2. **What\u2019s the breakdown of layoffs by department?**\n3. **How hard was each department hit?**\n\nIn the next section, you can see what we learned. If you\u2019re curious how we got to those results, see the section called \u201cAppendix: Methods\u201d at the bottom of the post.\n\n## The results, or layoffs by the numbers\n\n### What % of employees got laid off overall?\n\nBased on the companies we looked at, at companies where layoffs happened, about 19% of employees were laid off.\n\n### What\u2019s the breakdown of layoffs by department?\n\nBelow, you can see the % of total layoffs that each department constituted. In other words, of the layoffs that happened in 2022, 20% were salespeople, 5% were engineers, 3% were finance, and so on \u2026 and that a third of newly unemployed tech workers come from sales and product.\n\n![Chart showing % of total layoffs by department in 2022](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fof_total_layoffs_each_department_constituted_in_2022_68b8b4e6d6.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Layoffs by department\")\n\n### How hard was each department hit?\n\nThe graph above doesn\u2019t give the risk of getting laid off, however. All departments don\u2019t have the same headcount. For instance, according to LinkedIn data, engineers make up about 20% of a company\u2019s total headcount on average, whereas recruiters only make up 2%, about 10X less. In other words, if each department were to be hit equally, we\u2019d expect engineers to be laid off about 10X more often than recruiters. That\u2019s clearly not what\u2019s going on.\n\nTo get the full picture, we need to correct for department size and see how hard each department was actually hit, which you can see in the graph below.\n\n![Chart showing % of workers laid off, by department](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F2022_layoffs_department_007b58958a.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Percentage of workers laid off, by department\")\n\nThese results show exactly why using the label \u201ctech\u201d isn\u2019t good enough \u2013 there is a big disparity between different departments. According to our data, almost *half* of HR people and recruiters got laid off, as compared to 10% of engineers and only 4% of salespeople. The salespeople percentage shows the need to correct for department size, given that salespeople constituted the biggest % of overall layoffs.\n\n## What does this mean for engineers?\n\nAlthough engineers didn\u2019t emerge from this year\u2019s layoffs unscathed, our data shows that lumping everyone together under the \u201ctech\u201d umbrella is misleading. These insights don\u2019t change the fact that the people who lost their jobs, regardless of department, are hurting, and, unfortunately, layoffs are likely far from over.\n\nThat said, HR teams and recruiters were hit the hardest by far. Sadly these teams are often the proverbial canary in the coal mine \u2013 when a recession hits, hiring, and especially outbound hiring, is the first to get cut. Engineering, marketing, product, and design were all affected somewhat, and per capita, sales was affected least.\n\nSo what does this all mean for engineers? In our minds, the kind of anxiety produced by the news articles I referenced in the beginning is unjustified. Moreover, though hiring has clearly slowed down in the past quarter, after surveying our users, we saw that [a healthy amount of companies are still hiring engineers](https://interviewing.io/blog/companies-hiring-engineers-2022).\n\nHowever, the reality is that engineers are losing some of the leverage they had previously enjoyed. Given this climate, it\u2019s reasonable to expect that more engineers will be competing for fewer open positions than before, which means that:\n\n1. Candidate experience is going to degrade somewhat. Why? Sadly, companies caring about candidate experience are not motivated by doing the right thing. Rather, it\u2019s largely a function of how much leverage labor has in the market. As such, we\u2019re likely to see\u2026\n   - The return of homework assignments and coding quizzes early on in the process, even for senior candidates. When good candidates don\u2019t drop out of your process despite having to jump through hoops, the hoops, which are cheaper than interviewing with a human, will return.\n   - Interview questions will degrade in quality \u2013 when selling in an interview process is less important, companies will put less effort into designing bespoke questions that give candidates a preview of what it\u2019s like to work there and will fall back to doing the easy thing, which is probably leaning more on cookie-cutter Leetcode questions.\n2. The bar will go up. Because more candidates are competing for fewer positions, companies will be able to get more picky while still hitting their hiring goals.\n\n<https://interviewing.io/> is both a mock interview platform and an eng hiring marketplace \u2013 engineers use us for [technical interview practice](https://interviewing.io/mocks), and top performers get fast-tracked at companies. Companies actually interview our top performers anonymously, right on our platform, and leave feedback after each interview. If the candidate passes, they unmask and move to the next step (typically an onsite). Feedback is both quantitative and qualitative, and in addition to telling us if the candidate passed, companies also rate them on technical ability, communication ability, and problem solving ability. Technical ability tends to be most predictive and weighed the most heavily.\n\nAs such, to check our read on the market, we averaged the technical scores for successful interviews over the last few quarters to see where the bar has been and where it is now. The results are\u2026 compelling.\n\n![Chart showing how the engineering 'bar', in real interviews on interviewing.io, has risen over time](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FThe_engineering_bar_over_time_on_interviewing_io_1_cb7162b724.png&w=1920&q=75 \"The engineering bar\")\n\n## Appendix: Methods\n\nBelow is the list of all companies (either US-based or with a significant number of US employees) with layoff lists, through 7/26/22 with Snap (8/31/22) added on. Sadly, there have been more layoffs in the last few months, but at some point we made the call to stop adding new ones so we could actually get this post published. That said, we made the call to include Snap (8/31/22) as a late addition because they had enough layoffs to potentially change the results. Based on layoffs.fyi data, these companies comprise about 15% of tech companies who employed people in the U.S. and had at least one round of layoffs in 2022.\n\n| Date | Company |\n| --- | --- |\n| 8/31 | Snap |\n| 7/26 | Shopify |\n| 7/20 | Capsule |\n| 7/19 | Olive |\n| 7/14 | The Mom Project |\n| 7/13 | Tonal |\n| 7/7 | Cedar |\n| 7/7 | Next Insurance |\n| 6/24 | Feather |\n| 6/23 | Netflix |\n| 6/22 | MasterClass |\n| 6/21 | Tray.io |\n| 6/16 | JOKR |\n| 6/15 | Weee! |\n| 6/14 | Redfin |\n| 6/14 | Coinbase |\n| 6/13 | Studio |\n| 6/13 | Automox |\n| 6/9 | Stitch Fix |\n| 6/7 | ID.me |\n| 6/6 | Dutchie |\n| 6/3 | Coterie |\n| 6/3 | Policygenius |\n| 5/13 | Replicated |\n| 5/31 | Tomo |\n| 5/31 | BookClub |\n| 5/27 | Terminus |\n| 5/25 | Bolt |\n| 5/25 | PeerStreet |\n| 5/23 | Klarna |\n| 5/12 | Section4 |\n| 5/4 | Cameo |\n| 5/4 | Colossus |\n| 5/4 | Ideoclick |\n| 4/27 | Robinhood |\n| 4/25 | Clyde |\n\nFor each of the companies above, we did the following to get layoff counts by department:\n\n1. Used LinkedIn to get the total number of U.S. employees at each company. In cases where a company had both U.S. and non-U.S. employees (e.g. Shopify), we looked at what portion of total employees were located in the U.S. and then adjusted the layoff count proportionately.\n2. Went through each company\u2019s layoff list and tagged all employees with their department. We included the following departments: Software Engineering, Data Science & Analysis, Product & Design, Marketing, Sales/Account Management/Customer Success, Recruiting, HR (Non-Recruiting), Finance, and Operations.\n3. Because layoff lists are opt-in (see the section above called \u201cOne big limitation of the data: layoff lists are opt-in\u201d for more detail), we needed another source of truth, and LinkedIn seemed like the best bet. As such, for each department:\n   - For a set of representative companies, we searched LinkedIn for the list of people who had left the company in 2022. We chose a subset of companies that included public companies, large startups, and small startups.\n   - We compared that count to the count for that department from (2) and used the difference for each department as a multiplier on the number of people in (2). When we did this, we ended up with the numbers below \u2013 each bar is our calculated probability that someone from this department would actually opt in to be included on a layoff list.\n\n![Chart showing the likelihood of people listing themselves on a layoff list, by department](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FLikelihood_of_people_listing_themselves_on_a_layoff_list_by_department_de35c9da76.png&w=1920&q=75 \"How likely is it that people self-report being laid off?\")\n\nOnce we had layoff counts by department, we also needed to know how many people worked in each department so we could figure out how hard each department was hit. For instance, Stitch Fix has about 4500 employees in the U.S. Of those, 238 are engineers. Therefore, at Stitch Fix, engineers comprise about 5% of employees. To do that, we used the same representative subset of companies as above and cross-referenced LinkedIn to see how many people worked in each department and what % of total headcount that department constituted. After we got all the numbers for the engineering department at our slice of companies, we saw that, on average, engineers constitute about 11% of employees. We repeated this process for each department. This is important information \u2013 without knowing the relative size of each department, we wouldn\u2019t be able to reason about how each department was affected.\n\n*Thank you to Sam Jordan, Liz Graves, Santiago Munoz, the broader interviewing.io team, David Holtz, and Maxim Massenkoff for their help with this piece.*\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

Five years ago I founded interviewing.io, a technical recruiting marketplace that provides engineers with anonymous mock interviews and then fast-tracks top performers\u2014regardless of who they are or how they look on paper\u2014at top companies. We\u2019ve hosted close to 100K technical interviews on our platform and have helped thousands of engineers find jobs.

The post went live on August 1st, 3 days before Google\u2019s two-week freeze was due to come to an end, and I even called out that the post might soon be rendered moot. It looks like that did not come to pass \u2013 now, a month later, the giants still appear to be largely frozen (with some specific exceptions\u2026 see the post about hiring freezes for details).\n\ninterviewing.io is both a mock interview platform and an eng hiring marketplace (engineers use us for technical interview practice, and top performers get fast-tracked at companies), so we have some unique insights into how these freezes have affected engineers\u2019 behavior. In the wake of most FAANGs freezing hiring, we\u2019ve seen a not entirely unexpected uptick in our users\u2019 appetites for interviewing at non-FAANG companies. What *was* surprising, however, was engineers\u2019 appetite for technical interview practice \u2013 though we\u2019ve seen a marked decrease in purchases of Google and Facebook-specific mock interviews, people are practicing for technical interviews *in general* at about the same clip as before the freezes.\n\nArmed with these indicators, and in the spirit of being useful during a hard and uncertain time, we thought it\u2019d be interesting to survey our users once again to figure out 1) whether engineers are battening down the hatches and laying low for a while or if, despite the looming recession, they\u2019re still actively considering new jobs and 2) which companies are actually hiring engineers right now.\n\n**TL;DR** There are lots of engineers actively looking. There are also lots of companies who are actively hiring. Scroll down to see a massive list.\n\n## What we asked\n\nWe were curious about 2 things:\n\n1. Are you looking right now, and if so, where are you interviewing?\n2. Is your current employer actively hiring engineers?\n\nBelow are the actual survey questions:\n\n![Screenshot of the survey question: which companies are you interviewing right now](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fwhere_interviewing_b5ef2cf127.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Survey question #1\")\n\n![Screenshot of the survey question: is the company you currently work at actively hiring engineers?](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fwhere_hiring_d0172e4456.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Survey question #2\")\n\n## Are engineers actively looking for work, and are companies actively hiring engineers?\n\nBy all accounts, yes, it looks like they are, on both counts. Of survey respondents, 49% said they were in the middle of an active job search, and 51% said that their employer was actively hiring.\n\n## Big list of companies who are hiring engineers right now\n\nWe collated responses to both questions above and came up with a list of employers who are hiring. Because we are based in the U.S. and most of our users are here, we confined this list to either companies who are based in the U.S. or are actively hiring here. Note that the logos, descriptions, locations, and sizes below are enriched via Clearbit. We spot-checked the list, and made some corrections/additions here and there, but it\u2019s possible we missed something. If your company is listed here and something is incorrect, let us know by emailing [hello@interviewing.io](mailto:hello@interviewing.io).\n\n## How interviewing.io can help you\n\nIf you\u2019re a company who\u2019s hiring engineers and want access to the best engineers in the world, *we have them*. Our candidates convert about 3X better than other sources (including internal referrals) because we use technical interview data, instead of resumes, to identify top performers. Our candidates are the two things you want: they\u2019re really good, and they\u2019re looking right now. Sign up, and [start talking to actually great candidates](https://interviewing.io/employers/). We\u2019ve hired for FAANGs and startups alike and have helped thousands of engineers find great jobs.\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

The problem is that \u201ctech\u201d can mean anyone working at a tech company. You\u2019re an engineer? Of course, you\u2019re tech. You do ops? Great, you\u2019re tech. You do marketing? You, too, are tech! These are all critical roles at tech companies, and what I take umbrage with isn\u2019t the decision to label non-engineers as tech employees. It\u2019s deliberately misleading your audience by implying that \u201ctech\u201d refers to engineers specifically.\n\nI don\u2019t like imprecision, and I really don\u2019t like fear-mongering.

We've said before that spending a lot of time on your resume is a fool's errand, but if you\u2019re going to do *something* to it, let\u2019s make sure that that something is low-effort and high-return.

We don't do it, despite a lot of our users asking for this feature. The reason I've refused to build them is because, simply put, resume writing is snake oil. Why? Because recruiters aren't reading resumes. If you don't have top brands, better wording won't help.

This is the 6th post in our Guest Author series.*\n\n*One of the things I\u2019m most excited about with the Guest Author series is the diversity of opinions it\u2019s bringing to our blog. Technical interviewing and hiring is fraught with controversy, and not everything these posts contain will be in line with my personal opinions or the official opinions of interviewing.io. But that\u2019s what\u2019s great about it. After over a decade in this business, I still don\u2019t think there\u2019s a right way to conduct interviews, and I think hiring is always going to be a bit of a mess because it\u2019s a fundamentally human process. Even if we don\u2019t always agree, I do promise that the content we put forth will be curated, high quality, and written by smart people who are passionate about this space.*\n\n*If you have strong opinions about interviewing or hiring that you\u2019ve been itching to write about, we\u2019d love to hear from you.

You can reach him on *[*LinkedIn*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liornn)* and *[*Twitter*](https://twitter.com/LiorNn)*.\n\nHi, I\u2019m Lior. I spent close to five years at Meta as a software engineer and engineering manager. During my time there I conducted more than 150 behavioral interviews. In this post, I\u2019ll be sharing what Meta looks for in a behavioral interview and how we evaluated candidates.\n\n## Purpose of the interview\n\nThe interview has two purposes:\n\n1. Assess whether a candidate has a history of demonstrating the right behaviors that would make them successful at Meta\n2. Assess the seniority of the candidate i.e. junior (IC4), senior (IC5), or staff (IC6)\n\nTo do this, we assess eight main focus areas in the interview. In no particular order, they are:\n\n- **Motivation:** What drives them? Ideal candidates are self-motivated, passionate about technologies and products that have a real impact.\n- **Ability to be Proactive:** Are they able to take initiative? Given a difficult problem, are they able to figure out how to get it done and execute?\n- **Able to work in an unstructured environment:** How well are they able to take ownership in ambiguous situations? Or do they rely on others to be told what to do?\n- **Perseverance:** Are they able to push through difficult problems or blockers?\n- **Conflict Resolution:** How well are they able to handle and work through challenging relationships?\n- **Empathy:** How well are they able to see things from the perspective of others and understand their motivations?\n- **Growth:** How well do they understand their strengths, weaknesses and growth areas? Are they making a continued effort to grow?\n- **Communication:** Are they able to clearly communicate their stories during the interview?\n\nTo assess these focus areas, we ask questions on the candidates work history and dig into the details of how they handled various situations.\n\nTo assess the candidate\u2019s seniority, for each focus area we determine if the scope of the situation is something we\u2019d expect for a junior, senior, or staff engineer. We\u2019ll go into this in more detail below.\n\n## Interview Format\n\nEach interview is 45 minutes long, broken down into the following segments:\n\n- Introduction - **5 minutes**\n- Interview questions on the candidate's past work experience - **35 minutes**\n- Candidate\u2019s turns to ask questions - **5 minutes**\n\n## Example Questions and Answers\n\nBelow are questions and answers illustrating how we collect signals on the candidate for each focus area. In a typical interview, we\u2019ll ask the candidate five or six questions and dive deep into the details of each situation. Each question may provide signals on more than focus area.\n\n### Motivation\n\nExample Questions:\n\n- \u201cWhat project are you most proud of and why?\u201d\n- \u201cTell me about a recent day working that was really great and/or fun.\u201d\n\nExample Responses:\n\n- Junior: A story about a project they are proud of that had an impact on their team.\n- Senior: A story about a project they are proud of that had a large impact on their team.\n- Staff: A story about a project they are proud of that had a large impact on their org.\n\n### Ability to be Proactive\n\nExample Questions:\n\n- \u201cTell me about a time when you wanted to change something that was outside of your regular scope of work.\u201d\n- \u201cTell me about a time you had to make a fast decision and live with the results.\u201d\n\nExample Responses:\n\n- Junior: A story about a change they proactively suggested and drove that had an impact on their team\u2019s focus area. Usually only requiring the candidate themselves to work on.\n- Senior: A story about a change they proactively suggested and drove that had an impact on their entire team. Usually requiring three or more people to work on.\n- Staff: A story about a change they proactively suggested and drove that had an impact on their entire org. Usually requiring two or more teams to work on.\n\n### Able to work in an unstructured environment\n\nExample Questions:\n\n- \u201cHow do you decide what to work on next?\u201d\n- \u201cTell me about a project or task that was ambiguous or underspecified.\u201d\n\nExample Responses:\n\n- Junior: A story about an ambiguous task that the candidate took ownership of and was able to drive consensus from a few stakeholders in their team. Usually only requiring the candidate themselves to work on.\n- Senior: A story about an ambiguous project that the candidate took ownership of and was able to drive consensus from stakeholders in their team or org. Usually requiring three or more people to work on.\n- Staff: A story about an ambiguous project that the candidate took ownership of and was able to drive consensus from stakeholders in their org. Usually requiring two or more teams to work on.\n\n### Perseverance\n\nExample Questions:\n\n- \u201cTell me about a time when you needed to overcome external obstacles to complete\u201d a task or project.\n- \u201cTell me about a time a project took longer as expected.\u201d\n\nExample Responses:\n\n- Junior: A story about a task with many technical difficulties and how they overcame each blocker.\n- Senior: A story about a project with many technical difficulties that were blocking their team and how they overcame each blocker.\n- Staff: A story about a project with many technical difficulties that were blocking many teams and how they overcame each blocker.\n\n### Conflict Resolution and Empathy\n\nExample Questions:\n\n- \u201cTell me about a person or team who you found most challenging to work with.\u201d\n- \u201cTell me about a time you disagreed with a coworker.\u201d\n- \u201cTell me about a situation where two teams couldn\u2019t agree on a path forward.\u201d\n\nExample Responses:\n\n- Junior: A story about how they were able to work through a disagreement with a coworker on an implementation detail of a larger project.\n- Senior: A story about how they were able to work through a disagreement with a few coworkers or team leads on the direction of a larger project.\n- Staff: A story about how they were able to work through a disagreement with two or more teams on the direction of a large project.\n\n### Growth\n\nExample Questions:\n\n- \u201cDescribe a situation when you made a mistake, and what you learned from it.\u201d\n- \u201cTell me about some constructive feedback you received from a manager or a peer\u201d\n- \u201cTell me about a skill set that you observed in a peer or mentor that you want to develop in the next six months.\u201d\n\nExample Responses:\n\n- Junior: A story about a new technology they want to learn and the progress they have made to learn it.\n- Senior: A story about a soft skill or technical skill they want to developer and the progress they have made to learn it. Usually a skill that will have the potential to affect the entire team.\n- Staff: A story about a soft skill or technical skill they want to developer and the progress they have made to learn it. Usually a skill that will have the potential to affect two or more teams.\n\n### Communication\n\nGenerally covered during the interview as to how clearly they are explaining the stories. There is also some overlap with Empathy and how they communicate with others.\n\n## Putting it all together\n\nAfter the interview, the interviewer will compile their feedback and give a hire/no-hire recommendation as well as the candidate\u2019s seniority. The hire/no-hire decision is given as a spectrum, ranging from low confidence to high confidence. This is illustrated below:\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/unnamed_f12d624be3.jpg)\n\nThe recommendation is compiled from the signals the interviewer collected on the eight focus areas. Typically, this looks like the following:\n\n- For junior engineers, a hire recommendation is given if they displayed positive signals on nearly all of the eight focus areas.\n- For senior engineers, a hire recommendation is given if they displayed positive signals on nearly all of the eight focus areas AND at the level we would expect for senior engineers. Otherwise, a no-hire recommendation is given.\n- For staff engineers, a hire recommendation is given if they showed positive signals on nearly all of the eight focus areas AND at the level we would expect for staff engineers. Otherwise, a no-hire recommendation is given at a staff level, although they may receive a hire recommendation at a senior level.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the interviewer\u2019s decision is not final. Once all interview feedback has been collected from all interviews, the interviewers will discuss any concerns or strengths of the candidate with a \u201cdebrief committee\u201d.\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

Here\u2019s what it had to say:\n\n*The global resume writing industry was valued at approximately $1.37 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow steadily, reaching around $1.44 billion by 2025, and about $1.59 billion by 2033... The growth is driven by increased demand for professional resume services due to heightened job market competition, coupled with advancements in technology and personalization through AI-driven resume writing tools.*\n\nI don\u2019t know if these numbers are exactly true, and I don't know what portion of that is resume writing for engineers specifically, but it doesn\u2019t really matter. I am certain that they are directionally correct. As the market has gotten worse, I\u2019ve heard more and more job seekers ask for resume reviews and rewrites, and I\u2019ve seen many companies in the interview prep space start offering resume reviews.\n\nThey\u2019re all selling snake oil, and no one should spend a dime on it. I\u2019ll explain why in a little bit, but first let\u2019s talk about something else I found on the internet.\n\nA few days ago, I saw [this post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/1jhitoc/recruiter_accidently_emailed_me_her_secret/?share_id=WXxsyzj2kiIrpK7t6Xj66). It was a leaked internal set of hiring requirements (sometimes called a \u201chiring spec\u201d) that looked like this:\n\n![Image 1 from reddit post showing leaked internal set of hiring requirements](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/recruiter_accidently_emailed_me_her_secret_internal_v0_bbcbihi64bqe1_b9ed19715a.png)\n  \n![Image 2 from reddit post showing leaked internal set of hiring requirements](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/recruiter_accidently_emailed_me_her_secret_internal_v0_j2stzky64bqe1_89a24b8843.png)\n  \n\nOf course, there was the usual Reddit shock and awe and pearl clutching about whether this hiring spec could be real.\n\nYes, it\u2019s real. As someone who\u2019s been in hiring for over a decade, I\u2019m certain of it. And not only is it real, but it\u2019s routine. It\u2019s business as usual.\n\nI\u2019ve been a head of talent at top startups, and I used to run my own recruiting agency where I hired for a bunch of companies who have since become household names. When I worked as an agency recruiter 10 years ago, companies regularly shared documents like this one with me. The only difference between then and now is the idea of a \u201cdiversity bonus.\u201d Everything else hasn\u2019t changed in a decade.\n\nDocuments like this are why I quit recruiting to start interviewing.io.\n\nAnd documents like this are the reason that the entirety of the resume writing profession is a snake oil pit.\n\nThere is one notable exception to this rule, which I\u2019ll talk about, but most people should not spend a dime on resume writers. Here\u2019s why.\n\n## Recruiters aren\u2019t reading your resume. They\u2019re skimming it for very specific things.\n\nIn 2024, we ran a [study](https://interviewing.io/blog/are-recruiters-better-than-a-coin-flip-at-judging-resumes) where we asked 76 recruiters to look at resumes and indicate which candidates they\u2019d want to interview. Recruiters are most likely to contact you if:\n\n- You look good on paper (i.e., you have top-tier companies and/or schools on your resume\u2026 just like in the \u201chiring spec\u201d above)\n- You belong to a group that\u2019s been traditionally underrepresented in tech (i.e., you\u2019re a woman or a person of color\u2026 just like in the \u201chiring spec\u201d above)\n- To some extent, if you have niche skills (e.g., ML engineering)\n\nWhat's missing? Things like, for example, having a quantifiable impact or demonstrating teamwork. Essentially, everything recruiters look for is stuff that you either have or you don't.\n\nIn this same study, we also learned that when recruiters do look at resumes, they spend an average of 30 seconds reviewing them. That's not enough time to read every bullet. Instead, they are mainly skimming for recognizable companies and schools.\n\nHere is an excellent example, [also from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/qhg5jo/this_resume_got_me_an_interview/), that makes this difference very clear.\n\n![this resume got me an interview 1.png](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/this_resume_got_me_an_interview_1_4beabb1543.png)\n\nThis resume certainly passes the skim-test: good companies, appropriate roles, and a good university too. It's only when you actually spend more than 30 seconds reading the resume that you learn that not only is this resume obviously fake, but it also celebrates accomplishments like \"Spread Herpes STD to 60% of intern team.\u201d And yet, it got a 90% callback rate. Recruiters just aren't reading the details.\n\n**In other words, either you already have what recruiters are looking for (which often may be different than what\u2019s explicitly listed in a job description\u2026 because they certainly aren\u2019t sharing the real \u201chiring spec\u201d) or you don\u2019t. If you have it, then you don\u2019t need a resume writer \u2014 though it\u2019s always smart to make it easier for recruiters to find the things they\u2019re looking for. If you don\u2019t have what they\u2019re looking for, no amount of agonizing over how you present yourself is going to move the needle.**\n\nSo, if recruiters aren\u2019t reading and are just skimming for brands, why do people agonize over their resumes and give money to resume writers?\n\n## Why the resume myth persists\n\nIn interviewing.io\u2019s Discord server, I regularly see requests for resume reviews. I also see other interview prep companies charging money for resume reviews. Presumably they charge because the demand is there. But why are people willing to pay for something that is completely useless?\n\nI think it\u2019s a mix of misinformation and the desire for control.\n\nRecruiters rarely admit that they\u2019re skimming primarily for brands. If you read recruiters\u2019 advice for job seekers, it almost always includes advice about quantifying your impact, including your side projects[1](#user-content-fn-1), and so on. These bits of advice are well-intentioned, I\u2019m sure, but they perpetuate a harmful myth and an exploitative resume writing cottage industry.\n\nThe other reason is control. Job searches are intimidating, and putting yourself out there is hard. It\u2019s much easier to retreat to the comfort of polishing up your bullet points because it\u2019s something you can control. You get into a routine, rewrite your bullets, and upload your resume to a bunch of places. Then when you don\u2019t hear back, you retreat to familiar ground, grind on your bullets some more, and rinse and repeat. Because it\u2019s easier to believe that if you can just get your bullets right, you\u2019ll finally hear back. That narrative sure beats out the idea that no one is reading your resume no matter how much you fine-tune it.\n\n## The notable exception: If you already look good on paper, polishing your resume CAN be useful.\n\nIf you\u2019re fortunate enough to have top brands on your resume, cleaning it up can be a good use of your time. I still wouldn\u2019t hire a resume writer because the details don\u2019t matter very much. Just make sure that recruiters can easily spot the brands.\n\nHere\u2019s an example. Take a look at the before and after screenshots of the resume below.\n\n**Before**\n\n![Before version of a resume from one of interviewing.io's users](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/resume_before_b8d5aa1c34.png)\n\nThis resume belongs to one of our users who was kind enough to let us share it. He actually has two of the three things that recruiters look for: FAANG experience and a niche title (ML engineer). But both are buried! And the section that gets the most attention is wasted on undergraduate awards.\n\nAs you can see, he spent almost 3 years at Apple, but a recruiter skimming his resume might not notice that because it was a while ago. Instead, he showcases an undergrad award and some technologies/languages that he knows. Neither of those is nearly as useful to recruiters as FAANG experience.\n\nHis current title is also ML engineer, and one at the Principal level at that. But it wasn\u2019t always: He went from back-end to SRE to a little bit of everything to ML, and because of that, it\u2019s possible a recruiter would miss it as well.\n\nAfter\n\n![After version of a resume from one of interviewing.io's users](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/resume_after_c148ae3b62.png)\n\nWe edited this candidate\u2019s resume to put all the things recruiters look for at the very top of the resume and moved the buzzword soup to the bottom. This candidate is obviously well-positioned because he has FAANG experience, several top schools, and niche skills \u2014 but before, many recruiters didn\u2019t spot them. After he made these changes, the number of interviews he got increased by 8X.\n\nNote that we didn\u2019t really rewrite anything. We just moved stuff around. You can do this yourself without needing a professional writer.\n\n## For everyone else, stop working on your resume, and start doing outreach.\n\nIf you\u2019re like most people, you don\u2019t have top brands on their resume, so no amount of rewriting is going to move the needle much. Instead of agonizing over it, stop applying and start doing outreach to hiring managers. It\u2019s your best shot to get noticed and to get someone to look at you as a human being, instead of a collection of brands. [Here\u2019s how to do it](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-to-get-in-the-door-at-top-companies-cold-out-reach-to-hiring-managers-part-2). For a deeper dive into both resume writing and how to get in the door, you can read [*Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/195570600X) (both [chapters are also available for free](https://bctci.co/free-chapters)).\n\nFootnotes:\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. Will side projects help you get a job? Good question and one that should be teased apart a bit. Getting a job has two components: getting in the door and doing well in interviews. In general, side projects are useless for getting in the door. Yes, every once in a while, a side project goes viral. Or if you build something really cool with your target company\u2019s API, it can get some attention. But that\u2019s pretty rare. Most side projects that adorn resumes go completely unnoticed. When it comes to performing well in interviews, it depends. If the companies you\u2019re interviewing at test you on practical skills, then they can be a great use of time. They can also be a great use of time to help you understand how APIs work, how the internet works, how clients and servers talk to each other, and so on. But if the companies you\u2019re targeting primarily ask algorithmic questions, then side projects probably aren\u2019t the best use of time. Finally, will side projects make you a better engineer? Absolutely. And that\u2019s the best reason to do them. But that\u2019s not quite the same as getting a job, is it? Once you're actively looking for a job, your time is better spent on interview prep and outreach. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

This is the inaugural post in our new User Stories series.*\n\n*One of the biggest misconceptions about technical interview practice is that it's just for students. However, our data tells a different story. Experienced engineers are 25% less likely than new grads to pass their first mock interviews, according to our data. Moreover, in the current market, where the bar has consistently gone up since the downturn, practice matters more than ever. You don't have to practice with us, but you should practice... and don't forget system design \u2014 a lackluster performance in those interviews is one of the main reason people get down-leveled.*\n\n*My heartfelt thanks to my friend Jamie White for sharing his story (including two replays of failed mock interviews) and for coming to us for his prep in the first place. If you'd like to share your story on our blog, we\u2019d love to hear from you. Please email me at [aline@interviewing.io](mailto:aline@interviewing.io).*\n\n![Author avatar](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fjamie_headshot_a23fd91b6d.png&w=384&q=75 \"Jamie White\")\n\nJamie White\n\nJamie is a two-time founder and perennial engineer. His work has spanned medical devices (Common Sensing + MIT), photon detectors (MIT), and labor unions (Unit of Work). Most recently, he\u2019s been working on creativity tools at Roblox, where he\u2019s an engineering manager. Jamie likes tech but loves humans, spending weekends playing video games with friends and organizing queer community events. You can find him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jamieearlwhite) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamieearlwhite/).\n\nRight out of grad school, my friend and I started a company. I originally said I'd be there for a year or two and then go get my PhD. Seven years later, I left that company to start another. After three years, I shut the second company down and was deciding what to do next. The largest team I'd ever had at that point was around 30 people (including part-time + contractors). I was ready for a new experience\u2013a larger team, more financial security, the chance to dive deeper into technical topics. I decided I wanted to be a principal software engineer, and not for a 30-person startup. In the search for this experience, I found the Big Tech Interview.\n\nI had interviewed many people by this point, but none of the companies I ran had emulated the Big Tech Interview. I was completely new to it. The first super-important thing I learned is **just because you're qualified for the job, doesn't mean you can pass the Big Tech Interview**. I'm really smart. I got a 4.9 GPA at MIT. By this time I had worked with a pretty wide range of different software languages, tools, frameworks, ideologies, etc. I had managed 30+ people and could also plan and build complex systems solo when needed. I felt very qualified for the positions I was applying for. On my first Big Tech Interview, I did terribly.\n\nLuckily, it wasn't high on my list. I took advice from a brilliant friend and applied to my least favorite job first. The interview began. I'm a great communicator, breaking the ice and getting started was easy. I asked a few questions and got started, but I was already doomed. I hadn't written code in plain-text in ages. I missed some basic questions you should always ask. I didn't properly consider my edge cases. I forgot what a heap sort was, and there wasn't enough time to Google. My timing was off, and I wasn't sure how much I should talk vs code vs test. Didn't get the job.\n\nAn internal recruiter at a separate company had faith in me and gave me some great advice: \"Our interviews are really hard; you should go online and practice before you move on to that stage - I'll wait\". This is when it clicked. **The Big Tech Interview has a meta: video game lingo for a strategy that is agreed on by the community to be most effective**.\n\n**Not only do Big Tech Interviews have a meta, but because in this hiring game you are competing against other candidates, not learning that meta puts you at a huge disadvantage, even if you're a great match for the job**. I called around my friends who had been hired by Big Tech companies or hired for them, asking how to play the game most effectively. One particular friend blew my mind with how much she knew about Big Tech hiring, including the interview meta: Aline Lerner. Aline founded a company\u2013interviewing.io\u2013to help people like me. Because I'm such an awesome friend, I got started for free, although I ultimately also paid instead of begging Aline for more freebies. It was that good.\n\nAline led me to the two key features at interviewing.io that would ultimately prevent me from bombing again: practice interviews and recorded interviews. Practice interviews pair you with someone who actually interviews for a Big Tech company at the level you're shooting for. You enter a blind, simulated remote interviewing environment. You can set the collaborative editor to plain-text or one of many programming languages. A diagramming whiteboard mimics similar tools that companies provide during their interviews. After a brief introduction, the interviewer asks if there is anything particular you want to focus on, and then for the next hour you are in a very realistic-feeling Big Tech Interview. I found these interviews to be slightly harder than the real-life ones, a great direction to err. When time is up, your interviewer transitions to giving immediate feedback and tips, all of which are added to an overall dashboard for the interview, along with a single rating from 1-4.\n\nHere are a few of my early failed interviews. You can watch them if you want, too. The first one is algorithmic, and the second interview is system design. Huge thank you to Jamie\u2019s excellent interviewers in these interviews, Continuous Hedgehog (algorithmic) and Indelible Hawk (system design), for their willingness to share these as well.\n\n## Algorithmic interview\n\n![Feedback of Jamie White's mock algorithmic interview](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jamie_failed_algo_928f505a54.png)\n\n## System design interview\n\n![Feedback of Jamie White's mock system design interview](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jamie_failed_sys_design_87e6a9d20a.png)\n\nOnce finished, you can revisit that interview any time you want through the interview recording. The recording not only includes synced-up audio, code, and diagramming but also includes a secret notes panel where your interviewer is jotting down their thoughts in real-time.\n\n![Interviewing.io interviewer notes panel real-time](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/user_story_jamie_white_comments_final_9f47e3c642.gif)\n\nWhen an interview is complete, you have the option to opt-in and publish your anonymous interview for all interviewing.io users to see. After Aline showed me this feature, I was hooked. I would pull up [interviewing.io\u2019s replay showcase](https://interviewing.io/mocks) and watch an interview over lunch, listen to one in the background while I worked out, or deep-dive into one, pausing to attempt answering myself first.\n\nOver about 10 live and 20 recorded interviews, I could see my ratings progressing upward. Weak spots became apparent, and I focused on them. I was grokking the meta, and I reached out to the recruiter to go forward with the tech interview. I did one more live practice session the day before the real interview I was warned about.\n\nI aced it. I still had nerves; I don\u2019t think you can necessarily rid yourself of those. And the problems were novel to me. I hadn\u2019t encountered them specifically in my practice. But thanks to my mock interviews, I was able to **quickly understand and solve these coding/systems problems, which meant my interviewer and I could move on to more advanced topics and talk about my work instead of traversing binary trees**. This also gave me time to learn more about the company and interviewer and have some fun, albeit nerve-wracking fun.\n\nUltimately, I got amazing offers, including from the recruiter who gave me that warning. All noted that my interview performance was high. If I had walked in and performed like my first ill-advised interview above, I would have had to settle lower down my list.\n\nIf you've been reading, you won't be surprised at the takeaway here. No matter how good at the job you are, you need to practice for the Big Tech Interview meta. interviewing.io was instrumental in getting me there, and I recommend them to everyone now. You'll be giving your job ~2000 hours of your time every year; it's totally worth the time and money to make sure you end up where you want.\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

Here\u2019s the data.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: February 25, 2019; Last updated: May 1, 2023\n\nAt the end of the day, money is a huge driver for the decisions we make about what jobs to go after. In the past, we\u2019ve written about [how to negotiate your salary](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter), and there are a lot of [labor statistics](https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-7/high-tech-industries-an-analysis-of-employment-wages-and-output.htm) and reports out there looking at salaries in the tech industry as a whole. But as with many things in eng hiring, there\u2019s very little concrete data on whether technical interview performance plays a role in compensation offers.\n\nSo we set out to gather the data and asked our users who had gone on to successfully get jobs after using our platform to share their salary info. **With our unique dataset of real coding interviews, we could ask questions like:**\n\n- **Does interview performance matter when it comes to compensation packages?**\n- **Do engineers who prioritize other parts of a role over compensation (e.g. values alignment) end up with lower salaries?**\n- **What else seems to matter in getting a higher salary?**\n\nTo be clear, this is an exploration of past average interview performance and its connection with current salary, versus looking at how someone did in an interview and then what salary they got when they took that specific job. In other words, we haven\u2019t paired job interviews with the salary for that same job. We believe that looking at these more general measures is more informative than trying to match single interviews and job offers, given [how volatile individual interview performance can be](https://interviewing.io/blog/after-a-lot-more-data-technical-interview-performance-really-is-kind-of-arbitrary). But our interviewing platform allowed us to look at performance across multiple interviews for respondents, which gave us more stability and more data.\n\n## The setup\n\nOn the interviewing.io platform, people can practice technical interviews online and anonymously, with real engineers on the other side.\n\nWhen an interviewer and an interviewee match on our platform, they meet in a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard and jump right into a technical question. Check out our [recordings](https://interviewing.io/mocks) page to see this process in action.\n\nInterview questions on the platform tend to fall into the category of what you\u2019d encounter at a phone screen for a back-end software engineering role, and interviewers typically come from top companies like Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Airbnb, and more.\n\nAfter every interview, interviewers rate interviewees on a few different dimensions: technical skills, communication skills, and problem solving skills. These each get rated on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 is \u201cpoor\u201d and 4 is \u201camazing!\u201d. On our platform, a score of 3 or above has generally meant that the person was good enough to move forward. You can see what our feedback form looks like below:\n\n![Screenshot showing Interviewing.io interview feedback form](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6f86b_screenshot_2017_11_29_09_10_46_6a2be62174.webp&w=1920&q=75 \"Interviewing.io interview feedback form\")\n\nWith this in mind, we surveyed interviewing.io users about their current roles, including salary, bonuses, and how satisfied they felt in their job and then tied their comp back to how they did in interviews on our platform. We ended up with responses from 494 engineers[1](#user-content-fn-1), and because compensation packages are so complex and vary from company to company, we analyzed the data in several different ways, looking at annual salary numbers, bonuses, and equity. **Then we tied compensation data to performance in technical interviews to see whether it matters, and if so, how much.**\n\n## The results\n\nWe looked at the relationships between interview performance (technical skills, communication ability, and problem solving ability) and the following: base salary, bonuses, and equity. In all cases, we corrected for location (being in the Bay Area means a higher salary) and experience (senior engineers make senior salaries), and where we could, we corrected for company size (bigger companies can generally pay bigger salaries).\n\nThe mean yearly salary for all survey participants was around $130k, and 57% of them reported a yearly bonus. For that group, the average yearly bonus was $20k. For people who reported a dollar amount for equity, the average was $54k. Below is the distribution of experience level/seniority of survey respondents.\n\nHere\u2019s what we found.\n\n### Better technical skills correlate with higher compensation\n\nAs probably comes as no surprise, **people who score higher on technical skills during interviews do make more money**. First, let\u2019s look at base salary.[2](#user-content-fn-2)\n\nBonuses, too, correlate with technical skills, with an additional point in performance potentially worth about 10k[3](#user-content-fn-3):\n\n### The relationship between compensation and other interviewing skills\n\nWe also looked at the two other ratings that interviewers give after interviews: communication and problem solving. **Better communication scores had a small but statistically significant correlation with salaries** (r = .15, p < .01), but we found no significant relationship for problem solving scores in isolation:\n\nWe also didn\u2019t see a relationship between either communication ability or problem solving ability when it came to bonuses.\n\nThe non-relationships didn\u2019t surprise us too much, to be honest, because with a relatively small sample size it\u2019s notoriously difficult to get subcomponents of ratings to show a relationship to something distal and complicated like salaries. It\u2019s very possible these relationships do exist, and with many determiners besides actual interview performance, like seniority and market salary norms, we\u2019d like to repeat this survey at a bigger scale to inform this question.\n\n## What else?\n\nWe asked engineers whether they felt satisfied with their role, and found that engineers who felt satisfied earned an average $14k more than engineers who felt dissatisfied.[4](#user-content-fn-4)\n\nWe also looked at people\u2019s perceptions of their own performance. [In a previous post](https://interviewing.io/blog/impostor-syndrome-strikes-men-just-as-hard-as-women), we explored how people rated their own technical performance after an interview compared to how the interviewer rated them and found that even experienced engineers aren\u2019t great at guessing how they did. **For this project, we were curious about whether overconfident engineers might net higher salaries (perhaps they negotiate harder!). So we also looked at people who rated their performance higher than their actual interview score \u2014 but found no difference in their compensation packages.**\n\nAnother thing we were curious about was whether people who valued money over other factors while making a job decision would have higher salaries. So we asked people to rank the most important variables in their job decisions. 32% of respondents said that a compensation package was the most important part of their decision; the next highest response was \u201cmatches my interests and values\u201d. But these question didn\u2019t have any predictive value for the actual salary amount: **people who said money matters the most didn\u2019t have significantly different salaries from people who say money matters the least**. It\u2019s possible that with salaries being impacted by so many outside factors, like location and role type, candidates don\u2019t truly have a lot of negotiating power over that salary number.\n\nWe looked at equity as well, and the average reported equity package size was 54k. We did not find any significant association between interview performance and reported equity packages. That said, enormous amounts of research have documented various salary gaps based on gender, race, and other important sociocultural and demographic factors, and we hope to repeat this analysis when we have more data.\n\n## What do these findings mean for you?\n\nInterview performance doesn\u2019t just get you in the door or not: it can have a demonstrable connection to your eventual compensation. For instance, **doing just a point better in your technical interview could be worth 10k or more, and with bonus, it could add 20k to your annual comp**.\n\nGiven how much technical interview performance matters, we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t suggest [signing up for free, anonymous mock interviews](https://interviewing.io/signup) on our platform. So, please go do that.\n\nAnd, if you\u2019re curious about what [our salary survey](https://interviewingio.wufoo.com/forms/salary-survey) looked like or want to participate and contribute to v2 of this post, please do so too!\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. Our salary survey ended up with 494 respondents, but because some people filled out our survey but had not yet done an interview on our platform, only a subset of folks had both salary data and interview data: N = 234, or 47% of our salary sample. Therefore in all the analyses where we compare salaries to interview performance, it\u2019s only for this subgroup. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n2. We ran both a correlation between these factors and a regression to correct for confounding factors like seniority and location. For the correlation, r = .22 and p < 0.001. For the regression, F = 16.06 and p < .001. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-2)\n3. As with base salary above, we ran both a correlation between these factors and a regression to correct for confounding factors like seniority and location. For the correlation, r = .17 and p < 0.05. For the regression, F = 1.63 and p < .05. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-3)\n4. Looking at it as a binary, satisfied engineers earned significantly more than non-satisfied engineers in a predictive test, F = 5.2398, p < 0.02, and satisfaction and salary amount are also positively correlated.

So we set off on a journey to acquire data to try answering it.\n\n## Methodology\n\ninterviewing.io helps prospective job candidates practice mock interviews with actual interviewers from the major tech companies like the aforementioned FAANG companies, as well as others like Dropbox, Uber, LinkedIn, and Slack.\n\nAfter each mock interview, candidates are measured on a 1-4 scale against three criteria (technical ability, problem solving, and communication) and are also given an overall hire/no hire rating.\n\n![Screenshot of Interviewing.io interview feeback form](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5a595_screenshot_2017_11_29_09_13_30_70d1167200.webp&w=1080&q=75 \"Interviewing.io interview feedback form\")\n\nFeedback form filled out by interviewers after an interviewing.io mock interview\n\nIn our analysis, we used these scores to estimate a candidate\u2019s overall skill level, which we would expect to be positively associated with \u201creadiness\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, we needed to know whether a job candidate\u2019s skill level and preparation ultimately resulted in the candidate getting the job. Since most real world interviews happen outside of interviewing.io, we surveyed our users to learn how far through the hiring funnel they progressed at three popular tech companies: Google, Facebook, and Amazon. For each of these companies, at least 150 respondents reported participating in the company\u2019s hiring processes. These were the hiring stages we asked for in the survey:\n\n- Applied\n- Recruiter call\n- Technical phone interview\n- Take-home assignment\n- Onsite\n- Offer\n- Hire\n\nWe also needed to consider variables that could affect a person\u2019s chance of progressing through the hiring funnel, but weren\u2019t necessarily related to \u201creadiness\u201d. In addition to the mock interview feedback ratings mentioned above, we grabbed the following data about users that we collect at interviewing.io:\n\n- How many mock interviews completed on interviewing.io\n- Self-reported career experience level (e.g. junior, intermediate, experienced)\n\nFinally, we asked survey respondents to share data that our platform doesn\u2019t collect but could be associated with a higher chance of landing a job. Here were those other attributes:\n\n- Gender\n- Possessed a computer science degree?\n- How many real tech interviews they\u2019ve attended as interviewee (excludes mock interviews)\n- How the person learned to code\n- How long ago did they last go through a job search\n\n## Relationship of respondents\u2019 technical scores to interview success\n\nIntuitively, you would think that better technical ability would be associated with a higher chance of succeeding at interviews. To see if this intuition holds true, let\u2019s look at the frequency of people passing a phone interview, bucketed by a person\u2019s average technical rating on interviewing.io, and see if a positive correlation exists.\n\nBased on 158 respondents who reported to have progressed at least as far as Google\u2019s phone interview phase, we observed a positive-looking relationship, but maybe not as obvious a relationship as one might expect.\n\n![Chart showing the percentage of respondents Who Passed Google Phone Screen](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F2020_10_28_passed_google_phone_tech_e66b4c760b.webp&w=1200&q=75 \"Percentage of respondents Who Passed Google Phone Screen\")\n\nLooking at respondents who went through the Facebook and Amazon hiring processes, the relationship seemed even less obvious:\n\n![Chart showing percentage of respondents who passed Facebook phone screen](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F2020_10_28_facebook_passed_phone_tech_3906569daf.webp&w=1200&q=75 \"Percentage of Respondents Who Passed Facebook Phone Screen\")\n\n![Chart showing percentage of respondents who passed Amazon phone screen](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F2020_10_28_amazon_pass_phone_tech_ad681a5e2e.webp&w=1200&q=75 \"Percentage of Respondents Who Passed Amazon Phone Screen\")\n\nWhile it would be simple to conclude there exists no relationship between technical ability and passing a phone interview, it seems more likely that we were experiencing selection bias. After all, 60-80% of people progressing past Google/Amazon/Facebook phone screens seems a bit high relative to what one might expect.\n\nCompared to the population of all people on interviewing.io, survey respondents with high average technical scores between 3 and 4 were over-represented relative to those who scored between 1.5 and 2.75.[1](#user-content-fn-1) Maybe non-respondents with lower scores and who failed Google/Facebook/Amazon phone interviews happened to be less likely to respond to our survey.\n\nSo that\u2019s pretty limiting. But let\u2019s keep in mind that all models are wrong, yet some are useful, so perhaps it\u2019s still possible to learn other stuff from the data. If the survey respondents\u2019 technical abilities weren\u2019t obviously associated with interview success, what about other factors?\n\n## More experience with real technical interviews is associated with future interview success\n\nWhen digging further, the factor that stood out most was how many real technical interviews the candidate had done in the past. Across all three companies, people who had completed 5 or more real technical interviews tended to have higher rates of passing a phone interview than those who had less real interview experience.\n\n![Chart showing probability of passing Amazon phone screen](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F2020_10_30_amazon_phone_familiar_ac8c45e063.webp&w=1080&q=75 \"Probability of Passing Amazon Phone Screen\")\n\n![Chart showing probability of passing Google phone screen](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F2020_10_30_google_phone_familiar_1_f346104f0c.webp&w=1080&q=75 \"Probability of Passing Google Phone Screen\")\n\n![Chart showing probability of passing Facebook phone screen](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F2020_10_30_facebook_phone_familiar_1_18d0557905.webp%3Fupdated_at%3D2022-11-22T13%3A41%3A23.440Z&w=1080&q=75 \"Probability of Passing Facebook Phone Screen\")\n\nIt\u2019s possible this large effect could have been confounded by other factors, so I iterated on the model to account for these factors, to see whether the effect of prior interview experience on interview success would continue to shine through.\n\nHere were the factors considered:\n\n- Average technical rating\n- Average problem solving rating\n- Average communication rating\n- Number of mock interviews completed on interviewing.io\n- Experience level\n- Gender\n- Did the person have a computer science degree?\n\nFor 171 respondents who went through the Amazon hiring process, a statistically significant association continued to exist between prior technical interview experience and succeeding in a phone interview. Below were the predicted probabilities of passing a phone interview for a typical respondent in this survey (males with a computer science degree and 4+ years of experience, with average technical, communication, and problem solving ability), conditional on their prior technical interview experience.\n\n| **Prior Experience** | **Predicted Probability of Passing Amazon Phone Screen** |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1-4 technical interviews | 65% |\n| 5+ technical interviews | 81% |\n\nFor Facebook we observed a similar effect:\n\n| **Prior Experience** | **Predicted Probability of Passing Facebook Phone Screen** |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1-4 technical interviews | 40% |\n| 5+ technical interviews | 71% |\n\nFinally, for Google applicants we observed that the number of interviewing.io mock interviews completed had the clearest association with interview success, not prior technical interview experience. While mock interviews aren\u2019t exactly the same as real-world technical interviews, they are conducted by the same kinds of people asking similar questions and using similar assessment criteria. Because of this, it seems possible that the effects of mock interviews on interview success could be similar to the effect of real technical interview experience.\n\nBelow was the estimated chance of passing the Google phone interview for the typical survey respondent, conditional on the number of interviewing.io practice interviews attended.\n\n| **Mock interviews on interviewing.io** | **Predicted Probability of Passing Google Phone Screen** |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2 | 69% |\n| 3 | 76% |\n\nLooking at the other variables we included in the model, we observed no other statistically significant relationships with success in phone interviews. It\u2019s possible those relationships actually exist, but based on this sample, we did not observe enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that no relationship exists.\n\nSo even after accounting for other factors, more technical interview experience was still associated with greater success in phone interviews.\n\nWe also wondered whether similar effects might exist when you get further down the hiring funnel. For example, could prior technical interview experience also improve your chances of receiving an offer after an onsite? We performed a similar analysis to predict the chance of receiving an offer conditional upon attending an onsite interview, but we found no noticeable relationships between the predictors listed above and the probability of receiving an offer. Sample sizes are naturally smaller when looking this far down the funnel, and perhaps the differences between candidates are smaller, which could be harder to detect.\n\nBased on an analysis of this particular group of people, it seems we have a pretty clear answer to the original question of \u201cWhat metric should be used to know you\u2019re prepared to succeed in a FAANG interview?\u201d\n\nThe answer is to **experience five or more real technical interviews**. Simple, right?\n\n## Why more experience with technical interviews helps you succeed in future technical interviews\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I find that answer unsatisfying. That conclusion seems *really* questionable and self-serving, especially when the recommendation comes from a company that offers mock technical interviews as a product.\n\nI don\u2019t blame you, and quite frankly, this result wasn\u2019t what we expected either. The metric of technical interviewing experience is probably just a proxy for some other phenomenon that does correlate with interview success in some explainable way. After all, it\u2019s unlikely that just showing up to five interviews will magically bestow upon you new talents.\n\nSo what is it about having technical interview experience that might be associated with success in future technical interviews? To dig even deeper, we followed up with survey respondents who successfully received an offer with Google, Facebook, or Amazon, and asked what factors they felt contributed to their success.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, nearly all respondents said practicing technical problems was the foundation for their success. So yes, technical competency matters, and no, past interview experience doesn\u2019t appear to be a substitute for it.\n\nBeyond technical ability, respondents shared anecdotes that hint at why such a relationship might exist, as well as some possible underlying factors that could explain what technical interview experience might proxy for.\n\n### Direct feedback from other people helps you improve quicker\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to get a question wrong in a practice environment, and it\u2019s another thing to get a question wrong when you have an interviewer looking over your shoulder. A few respondents shared instances when they performed poorly in an interview, and explained how those instances influenced their future behavior. These negative experiences clearly highlighted areas in their skillset or presentation that companies tended to rate less favorably.\n\n> *I bombed multiple phone interviews with both Google and Facebook where the questions were about graphs or trees, and the questions were actually trivial. I didn\u2019t have a formal CS background, and I knew that I was weak in those areas.*\n\nOnce identified, respondents addressed those weaknesses through study and repetition, helping them allocate their preparation time more effectively.\n\nFor one job hunter, a past [Google interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google#google) failure not only helped shore up a specific technical weakness, but also helped the person learn how to maintain a more focused mindset in general, which proved valuable in a future interview with Facebook.\n\n> *Because my main weak spot in my Google onsite was being rusty in data structures and algorithms, I studied key data structures in CLRS, such as heaps and red-black trees. The Facebook interviews did not actually ask me to implement any data structures, but studying data structures helped keep my mind \u201con the game\u201d.*\n\nObviously, there are many other ways to receive feedback other than getting it directly from another person. For example, respondents also made extensive use of LeetCode and Cracking the Coding Interview-style exercises, and I\u2019m sure many of you out there do too.\n\nHowever, receiving direct feedback from another person seems different for some reason. Whether it\u2019s about social acceptance or proving oneself or something else, feedback from another person seems to be internalized more, which can act as an efficient catalyst for personal growth as long as you keep your mind open to suggestions.\n\nRespondents found direct personal feedback to be very useful, not only from feedback received in real interviews, but also from direct feedback in non-interview settings.\n\n> *Whether it\u2019s interviewing.io or friends asking each other questions or any generic peer interview platform, practice is different than practicing yourself. I found interviewers to be a resource rather than just someone evaluating you which is something you don\u2019t get when practicing yourself.*\n\nWhile real interviews give you unambiguous feedback about your overall performance (i.e. you did or didn\u2019t get the job), you don\u2019t always receive specific feedback about problems you answered well or skills that you exhibited effectively. Simulated interview environments can be uniquely beneficial because they allow job seekers to engage in a two-way dialogue with the interviewer, which can yield more information than a simple \u201chire\u201d or \u201cno hire\u201d decision.\n\n> *For practice interviews, I worked with a friend who was also interviewing for Google and other FAANG companies. I heavily leaned on interviewing.io interviews from FAANG interviewers during the last stage of my preparation, to make sure I was ready for Google, Amazon and FAANG interviews in particular.*\n\n> *Knowing I received solid (and specific) feedback from FAANG interviewers was a huge help and signal to me that I was ready for Google and Amazon interviews.*\n\nSo maybe the reason why prior technical interview experience correlates with interview success is because interviews happen to be the most common avenue for receiving direct, honest feedback from other people about how you and your skills are perceived.\n\n### You learn how to communicate in an interview setting, which is different than how you communicate in everyday work\n\nTechnical interviews can also require different communication patterns than what you might normally use in a typical workplace or academic environment.\n\nFor example, some respondents believe that it\u2019s not enough to solve a problem correctly. Additionally, you are expected to narrate your thought process as you solve it.\n\n> *Another thing study materials remind people is the need to constantly communicate your thought processes during the coding interview. Having done many interviews (and many more pair programming sessions), this is second nature to me, but I know it\u2019s not second nature to everyone and bears repeating.*\n\nThis implicit expectation can catch some off-guard, particularly if their preparation focused solely on programming exercises.\n\n> *Solving Leetcode on your own is quite different from having to explain your thinking process to someone else.*\n\nThese perspectives echo the advice given by our [interviewer Ian Douglas in his guest blog post](https://interviewing.io/blog/ive-conducted-over-600-technical-interviews-on-interviewing-io-here-are-5-common-problem-areas-ive-seen). All five of Ian\u2019s tips help you improve how you communicate with your interviewer while you\u2019re in the middle of the stressful interview environment. At the end of the day, a debugger won\u2019t be making the final assessment on you, a bunch of human beings will, and the things interviewers look for encompass a lot more than the correctness of the code you write.\n\n> *It is okay to get some guidance from the interviewer. You actually can feel that the interviewers are evaluating more than just your problem solving skills (your communication, how you work as a team, will you be a good person to collaborate with, etc).*\n\nBy doing more technical interviews, you gain a better understanding of the unique interpersonal dynamics that exist during interviews. Those dynamics impact how interviewers assess you, and failing to adapt to those dynamics could obfuscate your true abilities. But once you\u2019ve gained that understanding, you are able to hone specialized interviewing skills like the ones Ian suggests and apply them in future interviews.\n\nOne respondent took this concept to an extreme, re-learning a particular programming language from his or her past to be used primarily for interviewing.\n\n> *Python is much more succinct and expressive than [C++](https://interviewing.io/cplusplus-interview-questions), [Java,](https://interviewing.io/java-interview-questions) or [C#](https://interviewing.io/csharp-interview-questions), which I had used earlier in my career. By not having to write all the braces and semicolons, I free my hands and mind to dig deeper into the problem and better engage with the interviewer. I haven\u2019t made my way up Paul Graham\u2019s succinctness = power hierarchy, but in an interview situation, communication is the most important thing, and Python allows me to communicate with the interviewer better than C++ does.[2](#user-content-fn-2)*\n\nThis tactic probably won\u2019t work for everyone. But there probably does exist a tactic that works for you. The more technical interviews you experience, the more chances you\u2019ll have to discover those tactics.\n\n## You learn a lot about how to interview effectively when you communicate directly with other people\n\nGoing back to the original question, we said that the metric you should track is how many technical interviews you\u2019ve experienced, because that is what the analysis of this particular set of people outputted.\n\nBut that shouldn\u2019t be your main takeaway. The real learning is to acquire another person\u2019s opinion about your interview performance, because you\u2019ll learn a lot of different things from that person\u2019s feedback.\n\nWe can help you accomplish that here at interviewing.io, with options to receive direct feedback from currently-employed Google or Facebook interviewers, and even help assess specific skills like systems design or front-end development. But as our survey respondents mentioned, there are other ways of receiving that direct feedback.\n\nAs I\u2019ve written before, [interviewing isn\u2019t all that objective](https://interviewing.io/blog/the-eng-hiring-bar-what-the-hell-is-it) because [people aren\u2019t always objective](https://interviewing.io/blog/interview-bias-pseudonyms). Given that interviews are still going to be conducted by other people for the foreseeable future, gaining direct feedback from others appears to be an effective tool for succeeding within the existing system, so you might as well take advantage of it.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. As an incentive for responding to the survey, we gave a reward of either a $30 credit toward a professional interview or a free peer interview on our platform. If there were any bias, we\u2019d have thought people who scored lower would have been comparatively more likely to respond, rather than less. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n2. The idea that Python might be a better programming language for interviews isn\u2019t totally crazy. Empirically, interviewing.io mock interviews conducted in Python have the second-highest success rate among the most popular programming languages. The highest? C++. So if you\u2019re blindly going by the numbers, the respondent should have stuck to C++. However, chances are that this data also suffers from selection bias: people who know C++ might be different in many ways than people who know Python. Key point: use whatever works for you. For this person, Python happened to work better than C++. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-2)\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

Only about a quarter of respondents guessed 10K or fewer.\n\nAs it turns out, most people were off by roughly an order of magnitude \u2013 the real number is likely somewhere between 7.5K and 10K\u2026 which means that the majority of people are operating on incorrect information when they make important career decisions. For instance, how might your answers change to questions like these if you knew that layoffs aren\u2019t as pervasive as you thought?\n\n*How do I act at work? Should I even look for a job; it probably makes sense to hunker down and keep my head down, right?? If I\u2019m in the middle of a job search, should I take the first offer? If I just got an offer, should I even try to negotiate\u2026 won\u2019t they rescind it if I ask for more money?*\n\nWe\u2019ll attack some of these questions, head on, in a future post, but in this post, we\u2019ll just share our estimate and how we got there, and hopefully we\u2019ll dispel some of the panic around eng layoffs and help engineers make decisions based on data rather than fear.\n\nTo get to our much lower estimate, we first looked at how many people total were laid off in 2022 and 2023 so far, independent of department. Then we did some analysis to figure out how many of those people were engineers.\n\n## How many total people got laid off in 2022 and 2023 (so far)?\n\nTo figure out how many people got laid off, we looked at layoffs.fyi. At some point in the last 2.5 years, you\u2019ve probably visited layoffs.fyi. It was launched by Roger Lee in February 2020, just when concerns that this COVID-19 thing might affect the economy went mainstream. The site does exactly what it sounds like \u2013 it tracks layoffs at tech companies. Every time a company conducts a public round of layoffs, it gets added to a growing list. Each entry includes a layoff count, and a small subset of entries include a link to a list (usually in a Google doc) of actual people who were let go, as well as some info about them (name, LinkedIn, geography, title, and so on).\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Layoff_lists_on_layoffs_fyi_1_2ad6abbed9.png)\n\nThe meat of layoffs.fyi is a giant Airtable embedded into the site, which means you can filter the data, like so (I had to go city by city rather than just saying \u201cUnited States\u201d because many rows had the country mislabeled):\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/unnamed_f610896c24.png)\n\nOnce you filter on just the U.S., you get 163,296 layoffs total in 2022 and 50,263 layoffs total in 2023 so far, making for a grand total of 213,559.\n\nWe saw this estimate roughly corroborated in a [recent post by Crunchbase News](https://news.crunchbase.com/startups/tech-layoffs). They also used layoffs.fyi as a source but ended up with a more conservative estimate of 153,000.\n\n**So, TL;DR somewhere between 150K and 200K people got laid off total**.\n\n## How many of those people are engineers?\n\nWe recently did an analysis, where we looked at a mix of layoffs.fyi and LinkedIn data to figure out [how much layoffs affected engineers vs. other departments](https://interviewing.io/blog/2022-layoffs-engineers-vs-other-departments). As it turned out, about 5% of total layoffs were engineers, as of the publication date of that post (October 2022)[1](#user-content-fn-1). I expect that this figure has held up over the past few months.\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/of_total_layoffs_each_department_constituted_in_2022_68b8b4e6d6.png)\n\n**If we put all this info together, we\u2019re looking at something like 7.5K-10K engineers who were affected by layoffs between the start of 2022 and now, which is a far cry from the 50K-100K+ that most people had guessed.**[2](#user-content-fn-2)\n\nWhile our hearts go out to all those affected, especially in cases when the layoff was a function of poor planning by the company rather than anything to do with the engineer\u2019s performance, it\u2019s important to put these numbers in perspective and temper the rising urge to panic with some cold, hard data.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. If you\u2019re curious, even though only 5% of total layoffs were engineers, about 10% of engineers were laid off. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n2. A few high-profile companies with layoff lists are likely outliers: Meta and Coinbase. Both of those companies had engineers comprise more than 5% of layoffs, but in both cases, the lists were primarily composed of junior engineers. That doesn\u2019t make it any less painful for the people involved, of course, but from what we saw, eng layoffs were not generally so skewed toward junior engineers. For a really useful analysis of Meta layoffs specifically, please see this [Github repo](https://github.com/cjporteo/meta-layoffs-analysis). [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-2)\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

Here are 5 common problem areas I\u2019ve seen.\n\nBy Ian Douglas | Published: October 14, 2020; Last updated: May 1, 2023\n\n*Hey, Aline (founder of interviewing.io) here. This is the second post in our Guest Author series The first post talked about* [red flags you might encounter while interviewing with companies](https://interviewing.io/blog/6-red-flags-i-saw-while-doing-60-technical-interviews-in-30-days)*. Complementarily, this post,* *authored by one of our prolific, long-time interviewers*, *explores common missteps that interviewees make.*\n\n*One of the things I\u2019m most excited about with the Guest Author series is the diversity of opinions it\u2019s bringing to our blog. Technical interviewing and hiring is fraught with controversy, and not everything these posts contain will be in line with my opinions or the official opinions of interviewing.io. But that\u2019s what\u2019s great about it. After over a decade in this business, I still don\u2019t think there\u2019s a right way to conduct interviews, and I think hiring is always going to be a bit of a mess because it\u2019s a fundamentally human process. Even if we don\u2019t always agree, I do promise that the content we put forth will be curated, high quality, and written by smart people who are passionate about this space.*\n\n*If you have strong opinions about interviewing or hiring that you\u2019ve been itching to write about, we\u2019d love to hear from you. Please email me at [aline@interviewing.io](mailto:aline@interviewing.io) to get started.*\n\n![Author avatar](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FIan_Douglas_44c37f40a1.jpg&w=384&q=75 \"Ian Douglas\")\n\nIan Douglas\n\nWilliam Ian Douglas goes by \u201cIan\u201d, and uses he/him pronouns. He lives in the Denver, Colorado region and graduated from a Computer Engineering program in 1996. His career spans back-end systems, API architecture, DevOps/DBA duties and security, and has been a team lead managing small teams, and Director of Engineering. Ian branched out into professional technical interview coaching in 2014, and in 2017 pivoted his entire career to teaching software development for the Turing School of Software & Design in the Denver area. He joined interviewing.io as a contract interviewer in the summer of 2017 and is a big fan of the data analytics blog posts that IIO produces to help expose and eliminate bias in our tech industry interviews. Ian writes technical coaching information at [https://techinterview.guide](https://techinterview.guide/) and you can reach him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iandouglas736), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iandouglas736) and [GitHub](https://github.com/iandouglas).\n\n**I recently conducted my 600th interview on interviewing.io (IIO). I\u2019d like to share lessons learned, why I approach interviews the way that I do, and shed some light on common problem areas I see happen in technical interviews.** Every interviewer on the platform is different, and so your results may vary. We have some excellent folks helping out on the platform, and have a wonderful community working to better ourselves.\n\n## The interviewing.io Mock Interview\n\nDuring our interviews on IIO, we rate people on three 4-point scales. A score of 1 means they did extremely poorly, and a 4 means they did extremely well in that category. I typically start my interview where everyone gets 3 out of 4 points right away, and then earn/lose points as the interview goes on.\n\nEvery interviewer on the platform will have some aspect that they favor over others. My own bias as an interviewer tends to be around communication and problem solving, which I\u2019ll point out below.\n\n### Technical Proficiency\n\nIn this category, I grade a candidate on how proficient they seem in their language of choice, whether they had significant problems coding an algorithm of a particular style, if I needed to give a lot of hints during coding.\n\n### Problem Solving\n\nHere, I grade a candidate on how well they break the problem into smaller pieces, come up with a strategy for solving the smaller problems, and also debugging issues along the way. The ability to think through problems while debugging is just as important as writing the code in the first place. Are they stumped when a problem happens, or are they able to find the root cause on their own?\n\n### Communication\n\nInterviewers really want to hear your decision-making process. This is also very important when debugging code. I tended to hire folks who would fit in well on smaller teams or clusters of developers. With that in mind, collaboration and easy communication are a good way to win me over.\n\n## Common Problem Areas I See in Interviews\n\nHere are the top problem areas I see in interviews, not just on IIO, but in general. I hope you find this advice helpful.\n\n### Common Problem Area 1: Jumping into code too soon\n\nI see this in developers of all types and levels, but mostly in the \u201cintermediate\u201d level of 2-5 years of experience. They hear a problem, talk about a high-level design for 30 seconds or less, and are eager to get coding. They feel like they\u2019re on a timer. They want to rush to get things finished. It\u2019s a race to the finish line. First one across the finish line is the winner.\n\nRight?\n\nNope.\n\nPlease, slow down. Plan your work. And share your thought process along the way.\n\nPeople who take time to think out a mid-level design, whether that\u2019s pseudocode or just writing out notes of their approach, tend to spend less time debugging their code later. Folks who jump right into coding fall into what I call \u201cdesign-as-you-go\u201d problems, where you\u2019re spending lots of time refactoring your code because you need to change a parameter passed or a return value, or wait, that loop is in the wrong place, etc.. This is very easy to spot as an interviewer.\n\nSpending some time on mid-level design doesn\u2019t guarantee your success, but it might save you time in the long run by thinking through your plan a little deeper, and that extra time you bought could be used to fix problems later.\n\nAlso, as an interviewer, I want to see you succeed. Especially if you\u2019re \u201con-site\u201d (in person, or remote nowadays) because you\u2019re costing our company a lot more money in an on-site interview process. While I need to be fair to all candidates in the amount of help I can give, if I can see your design ahead of time, and spot a flaw in that design, I can ask leading questions to guide you to the problem and correct your approach earlier.\n\n**If you jump straight into code, I have no idea if your implementation is even going to work, and that\u2019s not a great place to put your interviewer. It\u2019s much harder for me to correct a design when you have 100 lines of Java code written before I really understand what\u2019s going on in your code.**\n\nI saw this lack of planning backfire in a horrible way in a real interview in 2012. The candidate was brought to my interview room by someone in HR, asked if they would like a bottle of water, and promised to return. We introduced ourselves and got down to the technical challenge. The candidate shared no details, no design, barely talked about a high-level approach, wrote nothing down, and started writing code on a whiteboard. (This would be my second-to-last whiteboard interview I ever conducted, I hate whiteboard interviews!) HR showed up a few minutes later, knocking loudly on the door, offering the bottle of water and leaving. The candidate, grateful for a drink, uncapped the bottle and started to take a sip when this awful, draining look came over their face. **The distraction of delivering a bottle of water made them completely lose their train of thought, and I couldn\u2019t help them recover because they hadn\u2019t shared any details with me about their approach.** They spent several minutes re-thinking the problem and starting over.\n\nOn the \u201cother side\u201d of this coin, however, you can spend \u201ctoo long\u201d on the design stage and run out of time to implement your genius plan. I\u2019ve seen candidates talk through a mid-level design, then write notes, then manually walk through an example with those notes to really make sure their plan is a good one, and now they only have a few minutes left to actually implement the work. Extra points on communication, maybe, but we need to see some working code, too.\n\nSo what\u2019s the best approach here?\n\nI typically recommend practicing until you spend about 5 minutes thinking through high-level design choices, 5 minutes to plan and prove the mid-level design, and then get to work on code. The good news here is that \u201cpractice makes better\u201d \u2014 the more you practice this design break-down and problem solving, the better you\u2019ll get. More on this later.\n\n### Common Problem Area 2: Communicating \u201cHalf-thoughts\u201d\n\nThis is a term I\u2019ve coined over the years, where you start to say a thought out loud, finish the thought in your head, and then change something about your code. It usually sounds something like this:\n\n*\u201cHmm, I wonder if I could \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 no, never mind, I\u2019ll just do this instead.\u201d*\n\nBack to my bias for communication.\n\nInterviewers want to know what\u2019s going on in your thought process. It\u2019s important that they know how you\u2019re making decisions. How are you qualifying or disqualifying ideas? Why are you choosing to implement something in a particular way? Did you spot a potential problem in your code? What was it?\n\nThis missing information is a hidden treasure for your interviewer. It takes mere seconds to change your communication to something more like this:\n\n*\u201cI wonder if \u2026 hmm \u2026 well, I was thinking about implementing this as a depth-first-search, but given a constraint around \\_\\_\\_ I think a better approach might be \\_\\_\\_, what do you think?\u201d*\n\n**That took maybe 2 or 3 extra seconds, and you\u2019ve asked for my opinion or buy-in, we can consider possibilities together, and now we\u2019re collaborating on the process.** You already feel like my future coworker!\n\n### Common Problem Area 3: Not asking clarifying questions\n\nAn interview challenge I often ask as a warm-up question goes something like this:\n\n*You have a grouping of integer numbers. Write a method that finds two numbers that add up to a given target value, stop immediately, and report those numbers. Return two \u2018null\u2019 values if nothing is found.*\n\nThis is a great question that shows me how you think about algorithms and the kinds of assumptions you make when you hear a problem.\n\nI\u2019ve been coding for a pretty long time. Since 1982, actually. There\u2019s no data structure called \u201ca grouping\u201d in any language I\u2019ve ever used. So what assumptions are you going to make about the problem?\n\nMost candidates immediately assume the \u201cgrouping\u201d of numbers is in an array. You can successfully solve this problem by using an array to store your numbers. Your algorithm will likely be an O(n^2) (n-squared) algorithm because you\u2019ll be iterating over the data in an exponential way: for each value, iterate through the rest of the values. There\u2019s a more efficient way to solve this in O(n) time by choosing a different data structure.\n\nGo ahead and ask your interviewer questions about the problem. If they tell you to make your own assumptions that\u2019s different, but ask if they\u2019re good assumptions. Ask if there are alternate data sets that you\u2019ll be using as test cases which could impact your algorithm.\n\n### Common Problem Area 4: Assuming your interviewer sets all the rules\n\nWait, what?\n\nYeah, you read me right.\n\nYes, you\u2019re there for the interview, but you\u2019re there to show them how you\u2019ll work on the team, and teams work best when there is clear, open communication and a sense of collaboration. Spend the first few minutes of the interview setting expectations, especially around communication and work process.\n\n**There\u2019s nothing wrong with having this kind of chat with your interviewer: \u201cMy typical work process in a technical challenge like this is to spend a minute or two thinking quietly about the problem and writing down notes, I\u2019ll share those thoughts with you in a moment to get your input. Then, while I code, I tend to work quietly as well, but I\u2019ll be sure to pause now and then to share my thought process as I go, and then walk you through the code more thoroughly before we run it the first time. Would that be okay with you, or do you have different expectations of how you\u2019d like me to communicate or work through the problem?\u201d**\n\nI promise you\u2019ll blow their mind. Most interviewers won\u2019t be ready for you to take their expectations into consideration like this. It shows that you\u2019ll work well on a team. You\u2019re setting the environment where you\u2019re advocating for yourself, but also being considerate of others. You\u2019re stating your intentions up front, and giving them the opportunity to collaborate on the process.\n\n### Common Problem Area 5: Not asking for help sooner\n\nAs your interviewer, I have a small amount of help that I\u2019m likely able to provide during a technical challenge. I can\u2019t coach you through everything, obviously, but I\u2019d rather give you a hint, deduct a point on a rubric, and see you ultimately succeed at the problem, than to struggle silently and spin in circles and make us both feel like the interview is a waste of time.\n\nAs a professional interviewer and an instructor at a software school, I\u2019ve become pretty good at asking leading questions to guide you to a realization or answer without me giving you the solution.\n\n**It\u2019s okay to admit when you\u2019re stuck. It doesn\u2019t make you a failure, it makes you human. Let your interviewer know what you\u2019re thinking and where you\u2019re having problems.** Listen very carefully to their response, they might be offering a clue to the problem, or might give you more thorough advice on how to proceed.\n\n## My Favorite Resources to Share\n\nWhen our interviews at IIO are over, I like to dive into a lot of feedback on their process and where I think they could use extra practice to improve. Generally, I spend 10 to 20 minutes, sometimes going way beyond my one-hour expected time slot, to answer questions for someone, and going into more detail on things. I **LOVE** to help people on IIO.\n\nHere are a few common areas of advice I offer to folks.\n\n### Communication\n\nThere\u2019s nothing worse than listening to your own recorded voice. But all IIO interviews are recorded, and I often tell folks in my feedback and in the review notes I type up afterward to listen to the last few minutes of the interview recording to review the feedback I give them. You can also pause those recordings and grab a copy of your code at any time. (These recordings are of course private to your and your interviewer.)\n\n**During the playback, listen to your own thought process and how you communicate your ideas. As you work through other challenges, find a way to record yourself talking through the problem out loud if possible, and play that back for yourself. You\u2019ll get better at articulating full and complete thoughts.**\n\n### Problem Solving and Mid-Level Design\n\nThe more common practice sites like HackerRank, CodeWars, LeetCode, etc, are great for writing a coded algorithm, but don\u2019t give you any way to exercise your design process.\n\nI send my students to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). **Euler was a mathematician, so the problems on the website will generally be pretty math-heavy, but you can change the problems to be whatever you\u2019re comfortable building. If you don\u2019t know how to calculate a prime number, that\u2019s fine, swap that out for whether a number is equally divisible by 17 or something instead.**\n\nI like Project Euler because the challenges there are just word problems. You have to think of everything: the algorithm, which data structure(s) to use, and especially how to break the problem into smaller pieces.\n\nOne of my favorite problems is #19 in their archive: counting how many months between January 1901 and December 1999 began on a Sunday. They give you the number of days in each calendar month, tell you January 1st 1900 is a Monday, and how to calculate a leap year. The rest is up to you.\n\nThe more you expose yourself to different types of problems, the better you\u2019ll get at spotting patterns.\n\n### Practice, Practice, Practice\n\nOne piece of advice we give our students is to practice each technical challenge several times. Our executive director, Jeff Casimir, tells students to practice something 10 times. That feels like a big effort. I aim more for 3 to 4 times, and here\u2019s my reasoning:\n\nThe first time you solve a problem, all you\u2019ve done is solve the problem. You might have struggled through certain parts, but your only real achievement here is finishing.\n\nIf you erase your work and start it a second time, you might think of a different approach to solving the problem, maybe a more efficient solution. Maybe not, but at least you\u2019re getting practice with this kind of problem.\n\nNow erase your work and do it a third time. Then a fourth time. These are the times when you will start to actively build a memory of the strategy it takes to solve this particular problem. This \u201cmuscle memory\u201d will help you when you see other technical challenges, where you\u2019ll start to spot similarities. \u201cOh, this looks like the knapsack problem\u201d and because you\u2019ve solved that several times, the time you take on high level design and mid-level design just shortened quite a lot.\n\nOne of my favorite technical challenges can be solved using a handful of different algorithms (DFS, BFS, DP, etc). If you think you can solve a problem in a similar fashion, solve it 3 or 4 times with each of those algorithms as well. You\u2019ll get REALLY good at spotting similarities, and have a great collection of strategies to approach other technical problems.\n\n## Shameless Self-Promotion\n\nI\u2019ve been writing up notes for aspiring new developers at <https://techinterview.guide>. It\u2019s not complete, but I have a lot of my own thoughts on preparing for technical interviews, networking and outreach, resumes and cover letters, and so on. I still have a few chapters to write about negotiation tactics and graceful resignations, but I\u2019m happy to take feedback from others on the content.\n\nI also have a daily email series covering several kinds of interview questions, but not from a perspective of how to answer the questions perfectly, there are plenty of resources out there to do that. Instead, I examine questions from an interviewer\u2019s perspective \u2014 what am I really asking, what do I hope you\u2019ll tell me, what do I hope you won\u2019t say, and so on. A small preview, for example: when you\u2019re asked \u201cTell me about yourself\u201d they\u2019re not really asking for your life story. They\u2019re really asking \u201cTell me a summary of things about you that will make you a valuable employee here\u201d.\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

The pipeline problem argument goes something like this: *\u201cThere aren\u2019t enough qualified women out there, so it\u2019s not our fault if we don\u2019t hire them.\u201d*\n\nMany people don\u2019t like this reductive line of thinking because it ignores the growing body of research that points to unwelcoming environments that drive underrepresented talent out of tech: STEM in early education being unfriendly to children from underrepresented backgrounds, lack of a level playing field and unequal access to quality STEM education (see [this study](https://www.kaporcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Computer-Science-in-California-Schools.pdf) on how few of California\u2019s schools offer AP Computer Science for instance), hostile university culture in male-dominated CS programs, biased hiring practices, and ultimately non-inclusive work environments that force women and people of color to leave tech at disproportionately high rates.[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n\nHowever, because systemic issues can be hard to fix (they can take years, concerted efforts across many big organizations, and even huge socioeconomic shifts), the argument against the pipeline problem tends to get reduced to *\u201cNo, the candidates are there. We just need to fix the bias in our process.\u201d*\n\n**This kind of reductive thinking is also not great. For years, companies have been [pumping money and resources into things like unconscious bias training](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/gender-equality/focusing-on-what-works-for-workplace-diversity) (which has been [shown not to work](https://leakytechpipeline.com/wp-content/themes/kapor/pdf/KC18001_report_v6.pdf)), anonymizing resumes, and all sorts of other initiatives, and the numbers have barely moved.** It\u2019s no wonder tech eventually succumbs to a [\u201cdiversity fatigue\u201d](https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-diversity-fatigue-20180604-story.html) that comes from trying to make changes and not seeing results.\n\n**We ran the numbers and learned that there really IS a pipeline problem in hiring \u2014 there really aren\u2019t enough women to meet demand\u2026 if we keep hiring the way we\u2019re hiring. Namely, if we keep over-indexing on CS degrees from top schools, and even if we remove unconscious bias from the process entirely, we will not get to gender parity.** And yes, there is a way to surface strong candidates without relying on proxies like a college degree. We\u2019ll talk about that toward the end.\n\nOur findings ARE NOT meant to diminish the systemic issues that make engineering feel unwelcome to underrepresented talent, nor to diminish our ability to work together as an industry to effect change \u2014 to enact policy changes like access to CS in public schools, for instance. Our findings ARE meant to empower those individuals already working very hard to make hiring better who find themselves frustrated because, despite their efforts, the numbers aren\u2019t moving. To those people, we say, please don\u2019t lose sight of the systemic problems, but in the short term, there are things you can do that will yield results. We hope that, over time, by addressing both systemic pipeline issues and biases, we will get to critical mass of women from all backgrounds in engineering positions, and that these women, in turn, will do a lot to change the pipeline problem by providing role models and advocates and by changing the culture within companies.\n\nLastly, an important disclaimer before we proceed. In this post, we chose to focus on gender (and not on race). This decision was mostly due to the dearth of publicly available data around race and intersectionality in CS programs/bootcamps/MOOCs.[2](#user-content-fn-2) While this analysis does not examine race and intersectionality, it is important to note that we recognize: 1) Not all women have the same experience in their engineering journey, and 2) tech\u2019s disparities by gender is no more important than the lack of representation of people of color in engineering. We will revisit these subjects in a future post.\n\n## The percentage of women engineers is low and likely worse than reported\n\nIt\u2019s very hard to have a cogent public conversation about diversity when there is no standardization of what statistic means what. As this post is about engineering specifically, we needed to find a way to get at how many women engineers are actually in the market and work around two big limitations in how FAAMNG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Netflix) report their diversity numbers.\n\nThe first limitation is that FAAMNG\u2019s numbers are *global*. Why does this matter? It turns out that other countries, especially those where big companies have their offshore development offices, tend to have a higher percentage of female developers.[3](#user-content-fn-3) In India, for instance, [about 35% of developers are women](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252437742/Why-does-India-have-a-higher-percentage-of-women-in-tech-than-the-UK); in the U.S., it\u2019s 16%. Why are these numbers reported globally? The cynic in me says that it\u2019s likely because the U.S. numbers, on their own, are pretty dismal, and these companies know it.[4](#user-content-fn-4) To account for this limitation and get at the U.S. estimate, we did some napkin math and conservatively cut each company\u2019s female headcount by 20%.\n\nThe second limitation is that reported numbers are based on \u201ctechnical roles,\u201d which Facebook at least defines very broadly: \u201cA position that requires specialization and knowledge needed to accomplish mathematical, engineering, or scientific related duties.\u201d I expect the other giants use something similar. What are the implications of this fairly broad definition? Given that product management and UX design count as technical roles, we did some more napkin math and removed ~20% to correct for PMs and designers.[5](#user-content-fn-5)\n\nWith these limitations in mind, below is a graph comparing the makeup of the U.S. population to its representation in tech at FAAMNG companies where said data was available, as well as an estimate of women in engineering specifically.\n\n![Chart comparing the % of women working at FAANGs to the general US population](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F41a7b_theres_still_a_lot_of_work_to_do_if_we_want_to_reach_gender_parity_in_engineering_2_7a234c8e90.webp&w=1920&q=75 \"% women at FAANGs versus the general population\")\n\nThere's still a lot of work to do if we want to reach gender parity in engineering\n\nIf we want to reach gender parity in engineering, especially when we correct for women in the U.S. (and whether they\u2019re actually software engineers), you can see that we have a long way to go.\n\n### Is it a pipeline problem?\n\nSo, are there just not enough qualified women in the hiring pool? It turns out that we\u2019re actually hiring women at pretty much the same rate that women are graduating with CS degrees from four-year universities \u2014 out of the 71,420 students who graduated with a CS degree in 2017, 13,654, or ~20%, were women.[6](#user-content-fn-6) So maybe we just need more women to get CS degrees?\n\nTop tech companies and their non-profit arms have been using their diversity and inclusion budgets to [bolster education initiatives](https://www.google.org/billion-commitment-to-create-more-opportunity/), in the hopes that this will help them improve gender diversity in hiring. Diversity initiatives started taking off in earnest in 2014, and in 4 years, enrollment in CS programs grew by about 60%. It\u2019s not anywhere near enough to get to gender parity.\n\nAnd even if we could meaningfully increase the number of women enrolling in CS programs overall, top companies have historically tended to favor candidates from elite universities (based on some targeted LinkedIn Recruiter searches, 60% of software engineers at FAANG hold a degree from a top 20 school). You can see enrollment rates of women in 3 representative top computer science programs below. Note that while the numbers are mostly going up, growth is linear and not very fast.\n\n![Chart showing increase in women enrolled in undergraduate computer science](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F26c4f_growth_in_womens_undergraduate_computer_science_enrollment_at_top_schools_1_8914d7d98a.webp&w=1920&q=75 \"Growth in women's undergraduate computer science enrollment at top schools\")\n\nSources: [UC-Berkeley](https://pages.github.berkeley.edu/OPA/our-berkeley/student-headcount-by-major.html), MIT [1](http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/305/bucciarelli.html) and [2](https://registrar.mit.edu/statistics-reports/enrollment-statistics-year)), and [Stanford](https://studentservices.stanford.edu/more-resources/office-university-registrar/everyone/enrollment-statistics) enrollment data\n\nTo see if it\u2019s possible to reach gender parity if we remove unconscious bias but keep hiring primarily from top schools, let\u2019s build a model. For the purposes of this model let\u2019s focus solely on new jobs \u2014 if companies want to meet their diversity goals, at a minimum they need to achieve parity on any new jobs they\u2019ve created. Based on the US BLS\u2019s projections, the number of software engineering jobs is estimated to increase by 20% by 2028 (or about 1.8% annually). Today, the BLS estimates there are about 4 million computer-related jobs. This projects to about 70,000 new jobs created this year, increasing to 85,000 new jobs created in 2028.\n\nIf the goal is to hit gender parity in the workforce, our goal should be to have 50% of these new seats filled by women.\n\nTo see if this is possible, let\u2019s project the growth of the incoming job pool over the same timeframe. Based on NCES\u2019 2017 survey, computer science graduates have grown annually anywhere between 7% and 11% this decade. Let\u2019s optimistically assume this annual growth rate persists at 10%. Let\u2019s also assume that the  \npercentage of graduates who are women remains at 20%, which has been true for the last 15 years. But, there are some gotchas.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s no guarantee that the seats earmarked for women actually get filled by women, particularly in a world where male CS graduates will continue to outnumber females 4-to-1. Not all of these jobs will be entry-level, so some portion of these jobs will be pulling from an already female-constrained pool of senior candidates. Finally, there\u2019s no guarantee that traditional 4-year colleges will be able to support the projected influx of computer science candidates, particularly from the top-tier universities that companies usually prefer. Below, we graph the net new seats we\u2019d need to fill if women held half of software engineering jobs (blue line) vs. how many women are actually available to hire if we keep focusing largely on educational pedigree in our recruiting efforts (red line). **As you can see, it\u2019s not possible to hit our goals, whether or not we\u2019re biased against women at any point in the hiring process.**[7](#user-content-fn-7)\n\n![Chart showing a gap in the labor pool](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa35da_there_arent_enough_women_in_the_labor_pool_to_get_to_gender_parity_based_on_how_we_hire_today_d19d624d91.webp&w=1920&q=75 \"There aren't enough women in the labor pool to get to gender parity (based on how we hire today)\")\n\n## So if the pipeline is at least partially to blame, what can we do?\n\nYou saw above that enrollment in undergraduate computer science programs among women is growing linearly. Rising tuition costs coupled with 4-year universities\u2019 inability to keep up with demand for computer science education have forced growing numbers of people to go outside the system to learn to code.\n\nBelow is a graph of the portion of developers who have a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and the portion of developers who are at least partially self-taught, according to the Stack Overflow Developer Surveys from 2015 to 2019. As you can see, in 2015, the numbers were pretty close, and then, with the emergence of MOOCs, there was a serious spurt, with more likely to come.\n\n![Chart showing education sources: BS in CS vs at least partially self-taught](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1086f_education_sources_for_software_engineers_3_6b49673d18.webp&w=1920&q=75 \"Education sources for software engineers\")\n\nSources: Stack Overflow Developer Surveys for [2015](https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015), [2016](https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016) and [2019](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#education).\n\nThe rate of change in alternative, more affordable education is rapidly outpacing university enrollment. Unlike enrollment in traditional four-year schools, enrollment in MOOCs and bootcamps is growing exponentially.\n\nIn 2015 alone, [over 35 million people have signed up for at least one MOOC course](https://www.classcentral.com/report/moocs-2015-stats/), and in 2018 MOOCs collectively had over 100M students. Of course, many people treat MOOCs as a supplement to their existing educational efforts or career rather than relying on MOOCs entirely to learn to code. This is something we factored into our model.\n\nDespite their price tag (most charge on the order of $10-20K), bootcamps seem like a rational choice when compared to the price of top colleges. Since 2013, [bootcamp enrollment has grown 9X](https://www.coursereport.com/reports/2018-coding-bootcamp-market-size-research), with a total of 20,316 grads in 2018. Though these numbers represent enrollment across all genders[8](#user-content-fn-8) and the raw number of grads lags behind CS programs (for now), below you can see that the portion of women graduating from bootcamps is also on the rise and that graduation from online programs has actually reached gender parity (as compared to 20% in traditional CS programs).\n\n![Infographic showing increase in women graduating from bootcamps](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffemale_grads_over_time_858b8b46ad.webp&w=1080&q=75 \"Female Bootcamp Grads since 2011\")\n\nSource: Course Report\u2019s [Data Dive: Gender in Coding Bootcamps](https://www.coursereport.com/blog/data-dive-gender-in-coding-bootcamps).\n\n\n\n![Chart showing 39% of graduates from in-person bootcamps VS. 49.5% of graduates from online bootcamps are women](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fonline_vs_in_person_ce041533ef.webp&w=1920&q=75 \"Gender Parity Online vs In-Person\")\n\nSource: Course Report\u2019s [Data Dive: Gender in Coding Bootcamps](https://www.coursereport.com/blog/data-dive-gender-in-coding-bootcamps).\n\nOf course, one may rightfully question the quality of grads from alternative education programs. We factored in [bootcamp placement rates](https://www.switchup.org/rankings/coding-bootcamp-survey) in building our updated model below.\n\nOutside of alternative education programs, the most obvious thing we can do to increase the supply of qualified women engineers is to expand our pipeline to include strong engineers who don\u2019t hail from top schools or top companies.\n\nIn previous posts, we looked at the relationship between interview performance and traditional credentialing and found that [participation in MOOCs mattered almost twice as much](https://interviewing.io/blog/lessons-from-3000-technical-interviews) for interview performance than whether the candidate had worked at a top company. And top school was least predictive of performance and [sometimes not at all](https://interviewing.io/blog/we-looked-at-how-a-thousand-college-students-performed-in-technical-interviews-to-see-if-where-they-went-to-school-mattered-it-didnt). And some of my earlier research indicates that the most predictive attribute of a resume is the number of typos and grammatical errors (more is bad), rather than top school or top company. In this particular study, experience at a top company mattered a little, and a [degree from a top school didn\u2019t matter at all](https://blog.alinelerner.com/lessons-from-a-years-worth-of-hiring-data/).\n\nBut, even if lower-tier schools and alternative programs have their fair share of talent, how do we surface the most qualified candidates? After all, employers have historically leaned so hard on 4-year degrees from top schools because they\u2019re a decent-seeming proxy. Is there a better way?\n\n## But culling non-traditional talent is hard\u2026 that\u2019s why we rely on pedigree and can\u2019t change how we hire!\n\nIn this brave new world, where we have the technology to write code together remotely, and where we can collect data and reason about it, technology has the power to free us from relying on proxies, so that we can look at each individual as an indicative, unique bundle of performance-based data points. At interviewing.io, we make it possible to move away from proxies by looking at each interviewee as a collection of data points that tell a story, rather than a largely signal-less document a recruiter looks at for 10 seconds and then makes a largely arbitrary decision before moving on to the next candidate.\n\nOf course, this post lives on our blog, so I\u2019ll take a moment to plug what we do. In a world where there\u2019s a growing credentialing gap and where it\u2019s really hard to figure out how to separate a mediocre non-traditional candidate from a stellar one, we can help. interviewing.io helps companies find and hire engineers based on ability, not pedigree. We give out free mock interviews to engineers, and we use the data from these interviews to identify top performers, independently of how they look on paper. Those top performers then get to interview anonymously with employers on our platform (we\u2019ve hired for Lyft, Uber, Dropbox, Quora, and many other great, high-bar companies). And this system works. Not only are our candidates\u2019 conversion rates 3X the industry standard (about 70% of our candidates ace their phone screens, as compared to 20-25% in a typical, high-performing funnel), **about 40% of the hires made by top companies on our platform have come from non-traditional backgrounds. Because of our completely anonymous, skills-first approach, we\u2019ve seen an interesting phenomenon happen time and time again: when an engineer unmasks at the end of a successful interview, the company in question realizes that the student who just aced their phone screen was one whose resume was sitting at the bottom of the pile all along** (we recently had someone get hired after having been rejected by that same company 3 times based on his resume!).\n\nFrankly, think of how much [time and money you\u2019re wasting competing for only a small pool of superficially qualified candidates](https://interviewing.io/blog/you-probably-dont-factor-in-engineering-time-when-calculating-cost-per-hire-heres-why-you-really-should) when you could be hiring overlooked talent that\u2019s *actually* qualified. Your CFO will be happier, and so will your engineers. Look, whether you use us or something else, there\u2019s a slew of tech-enabled solutions that are redefining credentialing in engineering, from asynchronous coding assessments like CodeSignal or HackerRank to solutions that vet candidates before sending them to you, like Triplebyte, to solutions that help you vet your inbound candidate pool, like Karat.\n\nAnd using these new tools isn\u2019t just paying lip service to a long-suffering D&I initiative. It gets you the candidates that everyone in the world isn\u2019t chasing without compromising on quality, helps you make more hires faster, and just makes hiring fairer across the board. And, yes, it will also help you meet your diversity goals. Here\u2019s another model.\n\n## How does changing your hiring practices improve the pipeline?\n\nAbove, you saw our take on status quo supply and demand of women engineers \u2014 basically how many engineers are available to hire using today\u2019s practices versus how many we\u2019d need to actually reach gender parity. Now, let\u2019s see what it looks like when we include candidates without a traditional pedigree (yellow line).\n\n![Chart showing reduction in gender parity](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fd27ee_gender_parity_is_within_reach_if_we_change_how_we_hire_ed3fb681a7.webp&w=1920&q=75 \"Gender parity is within reach if we change how we hire\")\n\nAs you can see, broadening your pipeline isn\u2019t a magic pill, and as long as demand for software engineers continues to grow, it\u2019s still going to be really hard, systemic changes to our society notwithstanding. If we do make these changes, however, the tech industry as a whole can accelerate its path toward gender parity and potentially get there within a decade.\n\n### What about specific companies? An interactive visualization.\n\nSo far we\u2019ve talked about trends in the industry as a whole. But, how do these insights affect individual employers? Below is an interactive model where you visualize when Google, Facebook, or your company (where you can plug in your hiring numbers) will be able to hit their goals based on current hiring practices versus the more inclusive ones we advocate in this post. Unlike the industry as a whole, built into this visualization is the idea of candidate reach, as well as hire rates \u2014 one company can\u2019t source and hire ALL the women (as much as they might want to). Of course, the stronger your brand, the higher your response rates will be.\n\nWe made some assumptions about response rates to sourcing outreach for both Google and Facebook. Specifically, we guessed a 60%-70% response rate for these giants based on the strength of their brand and their army of sourcers \u2014 when those companies reach out and tenaciously follow up, you\u2019ll probably respond eventually.[9](#user-content-fn-9) We also made some assumptions about their hire rates (5-10% of interviewed candidates). You can see both sets of assumptions below. And you can see that even with all the changes we propose, in our model, Google and Facebook will *still* not get to gender parity!\n\nWe also included a tab called \u201cYour company\u201d where you can play around with the sliders and see how long it would take your company to get to gender parity/whether it\u2019s possible. There, we made much more conservative assumptions about response rates!\n\nGoal:\n\nBy Year 2025\n\n50% Women\n\n05,00010,00015,00005,00010,00015,00005,00010,00015,00005,00010,00015,00005,00010,00015,000Demand (# women needed in the pool being sourced from)New women in pool (traditional + bootcamp)New women in pool (mostly top schools)\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\nYour company\n\nMy eng team grows this percent every year\n\nAt my company there are this many engineers\n\nHire rate (percent)\n\nSourcing response rate (percent)\n\nAs you can see, for the giants, getting to gender parity is a tall order even with broadening your pipeline to include non-traditional candidates. And while it may be easier for smaller companies to get there without making drastic changes, when you\u2019re small is exactly the right time to get fairer hiring into your DNA. It\u2019s much harder to turn the ship around later on.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRegardless of whether you\u2019re a giant or a small company, as long as hiring practices largely limits itself to top schools, the status quo will continue to be fundamentally inefficient, unmeritocratic, and elitist, and any hope of reaching gender parity will be impossible. Look, there are no easy fixes or band-aids when it comes to diversifying your workforce. Rather than continuing to look for hidden sources of women engineers (I promise, we\u2019re not all hiding somewhere, just slightly out of reach) or trying to hire all the women from top schools, the data clearly shows that the only path forward is to improve hiring for everyone by going beyond top schools and hiring the best people for the job based on their ability, not how they look on paper.\n\nI was recently in a pitch meeting where I got asked what interviewing.io\u2019s mission is. I said that it\u2019s to make hiring more efficient. The investors in the room were a bit surprised by this and asked, given that I care about hiring being fair, why that\u2019s not the mission. First off, \u201cfair\u201d is hard to define and open to all manners of interpretation, whereas in an efficient hiring market, a qualified candidate, by definition, gets the job, with the least amount of pain and missteps. In other words, meritocracy is a logical consequence of efficiency. Secondly, and even more importantly, while I firmly believe that most people at companies want to do \u201cthe right thing\u201d, it\u2019s much easier to actually do the right thing in a big organization when it\u2019s also cheaper, better, and faster.\n\nAll that\u2019s to say that there are no shortcuts, and the most honorable (and most viable) path forward is to make hiring better for everyone and then hit your diversity goals in the process (or at least get closer to them). Software engineering is supposed to be this microcosm of the American dream \u2014 anyone can put in the work, learn to code, and level up, right? Until we own our very conscious biases about pedigree and change how we hire, that dream is a hollow pipe.\n\n## Appendix\n\nTo assess whether there exists a pipeline problem, we need to estimate the number of job openings that exist, as well as the number of recent female job market entrants that could feasibly fill those roles. If a pipeline problem does exist, the number of job openings would be greater than the number of female entrants.\n\nFor this analysis, we focused on new jobs created over the next 10 years and ignored openings from existing jobs due to attrition. Unfortunately, engineering do  \nes have a significantly higher attrition rate for women than other industries, so likely the numbers are worse than they appear in our models.9\n\nThat said, if a company wants to meet its diversity goals, it seems reasonable to expect them to do so with jobs that don\u2019t yet exist, rather than on existing jobs whose pool of candidates we know are dominated by men.\n\n### Demand: Projected new jobs created\n\nTech industry net new jobs created = (# tech industry jobs prior year) x (annual growth rate)\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Tech jobs (2018): 4 million ([Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes150000.htm))\n- 12% growth 2018-2028, or 1.2% annual growth ([Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm))\n\n### Supply: Projected new women in job pool from top tier universities\n\nNew women in job pool = (# CS graduates prior year) x (annual CS graduate growth rate) x (% CS graduates that are women) \\* (% CS graduates from top tier schools)\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Current # CS graduates: 70,000 ([National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_325.35.asp?current=yes))\n- CS graduate growth rate: 10% ([National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_325.35.asp?current=yes))\n- % women: 20% ([National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_325.35.asp?current=yes))\n- % of all CS graduates from top tier schools: 25%\n\n### Supply: Projected new women in job pool beyond top tier universities\n\nThis represents female bootcamp graduates plus female CS graduates not from top schools.\n\nNew women in job pool from beyond top schools =  \n(# bootcamp graduates prior year) x (% bootcamp graduates that are women) x (% annual bootcamp graduate growth)  \n+ (# CS graduates prior year) x (annual CS graduate growth rate) x (% women in CS grads) x (% CS graduates not from top tier schools)\n\nBootcamp assumptions:\n\n- Current # bootcamp graduates: 20,000 ([Course Report](https://www.coursereport.com/reports/coding-bootcamp-market-size-research-2019))\n- % bootcamp graduates that are women: 40% ([Switchup](https://www.switchup.org/rankings/coding-bootcamp-survey#student-demographics))\n- Bootcamp graduates growth rate: 10% ([Course Report](https://www.coursereport.com/reports/coding-bootcamp-market-size-research-2019))\n- Placement rate: 50% ([Switchup](https://www.switchup.org/rankings/coding-bootcamp-survey#employment-outcomes))\n- % CS graduates not from top tier schools: 75% (see assumption from \u201cSupply: Projected new women in job pool from top tier universities\u201d)\n\nAssumptions for CS graduates beyond top tier universities are the same as those found under \u201cSupply: Projected new women in job pool from top tier universities\u201d, but taking the remaining 75% of CS graduates excluded there.\n\n### Company-specific Demand: Projected number of candidates needed to source for job openings\n\nNumber of women to source = (# Engineers employed prior year) x (% annual growth rate) x (% diversity goal) x (1 / hire rate) x (1 / sourcing response rate)\n\nIn practice, companies typically need to contact many people for any single job opening, since there is plenty of inherent variability in the sourcing and interview process.

We assumed a 1:7 ratio of PMs to engineers and a 1:7 ratio of designers to engineers on product teams.

[\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-5)\n6. This is *not* independent of the idea that deep, systemic issues within the fabric of our society (such as the ones we mention at the beginning of the post) are keeping women from entering engineering in droves. But, as I mentioned in the intro, laying the blame at the feet of these systemic issues entirely paralyzes us and prevents us from fixing the things we can fix. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-6)\n7. We couldn\u2019t find a public record of women\u2019s numbers by year and so are relying on graduation rates from Course Report as a proxy. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-7)\n8. These rates might seem high to recruiters reading this post. They *might* be high. We did try to correct for 2 things, both of which made our estimates higher: 1) this includes university and junior candidates, who tend to be way more responsive, and 2) this isn\u2019t per sourcing attempt but over the lifetime of a candidate, so it includes followups, outreach to candidates who had previously been declined, and so on.

Here are the results.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 30, 2022; Last updated: March 28, 2024\n\nAt interviewing.io, we\u2019ve hosted over 100K technical interviews, split between mock interviews and real ones.\n\nAs it happens, we know where many of our users currently work \u2013 they tell us that when they sign up to avoid getting matched for mock interviews with people they work with.\n\nGiven that we have this data AND given that we know how well people do in their interviews, we thought it would be interesting to see which companies\u2019 engineers are especially good at technical interviews. We looked at which companies have engineers with the best overall performance, as well as those that shine specifically on technical ability, problem solving ability, and communication skills.\n\nThe resulting top ten lists are below!\n\n## The setup\n\nOn interviewing.io, engineers can practice technical interviewing anonymously. If things go well, they skip right to the technical interview at real companies (which is also fully anonymous). We started interviewing.io because resumes suck and because we believe that anyone, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to prove their mettle.\n\nWhen an interviewer and an interviewee match on our platform, they join a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard, and jump right into a technical interview. After each interview, both parties leave feedback, and once they\u2019ve both submitted, each one can see what the other person said and how they were rated.\n\nHere\u2019s what the feedback form that interviewers fill out looks like:\n\n![Screenshot of the Interviewing.io feedback form](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FScreen_Shot_2022_03_30_at_5_06_30_PM_1511096ff8.png&w=750&q=75 \"Interviewing.io feedback form\")\n\nTo arrive at the top ten rankings in this post, we took post-interview feedback data from our users and grouped them by the company where they work.\n\nAbout 60% of our users work at FAANG and FAANG-adjacent companies (e.g. Dropbox, Lyft, Uber, Square, etc). The rest work at other large tech companies, startups of all stages and sizes, digital agencies. A small portion are students, some are entrepreneurs, some are career changers, and some are unemployed (as you\u2019ll see in a spicy tidbit below). For context, our average (and median) active user has about 7 years of experience.\n\nFor this analysis, we only included companies where we had at least 50 employees on interviewing.io (which meant that several companies were notably missing because they were just shy of that mark, including Quora, Asana, Stripe, and a few others).\n\n## A few words about statistical significance\n\nIn all the sections below, we\u2019ve listed the top 10 companies in each category. But how different is the 1st from the 10th, really? As it happens:\n\n1. Membership in the top 10 is indeed highly statistically significant. The companies that made it into our top ten lists do indeed have significantly better interviewees than the ones that did not.\n\n2. Most comparisons *within* the top 10 are largely insignificant. Though it varies a bit from list to list, in general, the top company is significantly different from the 8-10th ranked companies, except with the communication score, which is very noisy. In other words, a lot of the intermediate ranks could have gone either way.\n\nThat being said, here are the lists!\n\n## Best overall performance\n\nWe looked to see which 10 companies had the highest % of people passing interviews on interviewing.io. The average across all of our users is 54%.\n\n![Chart showing companies whose engineers had the highest interview pass rates](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FCompanies_whose_engineers_had_the_highest_interview_pass_rates_1_64103d0dbb.png&w=2048&q=75 \"Companies whose engineers had the highest interview pass rates\")\n\n## Best technical\n\nWe also looked to see which 10 companies had the highest average technical scores in interviews on our platform. The average across all of our users is 2.85 out of 4.\n\n![Chart showing companies whose engineers had the best technical scores](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FCompanies_whose_engineers_had_the_best_technical_scores_1_102f54f16e.png&w=2048&q=75 \"Companies whose engineers had the best technical scores\")\n\n## Best problem solving\n\nWe also looked to see which 10 companies had the highest average problem solving scores in interviews on our platform. The average across all of our users is 2.79 out of 4.\n\n![Chart showing companies whose engineers had the best problem solving scores](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FCompanies_whose_engineers_had_the_best_problem_solving_scores_1_711241b216.png&w=2048&q=75 \"Companies whose engineers had the best problem solving scores\")\n\n## Best communication\n\nFinally, we looked to see which 10 companies had the highest average communication scores in interviews on our platform. The average across all of our users is 3.22 out of 4. It was surprising to see how high \u201cUnemployed\u201d ranked (that is exactly what it sounds like \u2013 these are users who indicated they didn\u2019t have a job when they joined interviewing.io).\n\n![Chart showing companies whose engineers had the best communication scores](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FCompanies_whose_engineers_had_the_best_communication_scores_1_03760e4995.png&w=2048&q=75 \"Company engineeers' average communication score\")\n\n## Limitations and closing thoughts\n\nIt bears mentioning that there are some limitations to our data. As you saw at the beginning, where people work is self-reported, and though we\u2019ve done enough spot checking over the years to be confident that, *for the most part*, our users are honest about where they work, it\u2019s not a perfect system. People also don\u2019t always update their employer when they switch jobs.\n\nThere\u2019s also the issue of selection bias. Maybe we\u2019re just getting people who really feel like they need practice and aren\u2019t an indicative slice of engineers at that company. After having talked to our users for years and after seeing how they perform in real interviews later on, I\u2019m not too sure that\u2019s true, but hey, it\u2019s totally possible.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the obvious quantity issue. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re only including companies where at least 50 of their engineers practiced on interviewing.io. When we lowered that limit, the list started to look different\u2026 but we weren\u2019t confident enough in those results (yet) to publish them.\n\nLimitations aside, what does this all mean? I\u2019m tempted to speculate about why Dropbox dominated these rankings and what about their engineers is distinct from many of the other companies with great brands that our users hail from. Dropbox does also hire on interviewing.io, and from what we\u2019ve seen, they have an extremely high bar \u2013 many users who\u2019ve done well with other companies on our platform have failed their Dropbox interview. However, I will refrain from speculating beyond that, and I will also refrain from speculating about why certain companies do well on one score but not the others \u2013 looking from the outside, we simply don\u2019t know enough about these companies\u2019 inner workings or the nuances of the types of engineers they attract to come up with a credible hypothesis. However, I hope to hear from you, dear reader, if you have visibility into these things and can comment on them.\n\nYou might be wondering how this list of companies and scores resolves with interviewing.io\u2019s ongoing refrain about how resumes and pedigree don\u2019t tell you very much about whether someone is a good engineer. We\u2019ve seen over and over that [where you go to school doesn\u2019t matter](https://interviewing.io/blog/we-looked-at-how-a-thousand-college-students-performed-in-technical-interviews-to-see-if-where-they-went-to-school-mattered-it-didnt) (and in fact, interview performance among students from elite schools doesn\u2019t meaningfully differ from that of students in state schools), but we have seen consistently that where you\u2019ve worked in the past does have some bearing on how you do in interviews.\n\nSo, yes, where you work matters. The good news, though, is that it\u2019s not the whole story. We\u2019ve seen in the past that [people who take a bunch of Coursera and Udacity classes](https://interviewing.io/blog/lessons-from-3000-technical-interviews) on topics related to algorithms and data structures tend to perform better than people from top companies who have not. And we\u2019ve seen that after 5 mock interviews on interviewing.io, regardless of where you started or where you work, your [chances of passing real interviews will (on average) double](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-know-ready-interview-faang).\n\nOf course, the really interesting question in all of this is the holy grail of technical recruiting: *Does performance in interviews reliably predict on-the-job performance?* While we diligently gather data on the subject, I\u2019d love to hear from you. If you\u2019ve hired engineers from some of the companies in this post, have they performed better than others? Are there any patterns or anti-patterns that you have noticed?\n\nLife is chaos and pain. Interview prep doesn't have to be.\n\n![Video Preview](/static/images/cyber-corgi/artboard.svg)\n\nGet instant access to anonymous mock interviews, salary negotiation, and the world's largest library of interview replays.\n\n[Get started](/signup)\n\n#### Related posts\n\n[6 red flags I saw while doing 60+ technical interviews in 30 days](/blog/6-red-flags-i-saw-while-doing-60-technical-interviews-in-30-days)\n\n[Refuting Bloomberg's analysis: ChatGPT isn't racist.

Here\u2019s why you really should.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: April 23, 2019; Last updated: September 17, 2023\n\nWhether you\u2019re a recruiter yourself or an engineer who\u2019s involved in hiring, you\u2019ve probably heard of the following two recruiting-related metrics: time to hire and cost per hire. Indeed, these are THE two metrics that any self-respecting recruiting team will track. Time to hire is important because it lets you plan \u2014 if a given role has historically taken 3 months to fill, you\u2019re going to act differently when you need to fill it again than if it takes 2 weeks. And, traditionally, cost per hire has been a planning tool as well \u2014 if you\u2019re setting recruiting budgets for next year and have a headcount in mind, seeing what recruiting spent last year is super helpful.\n\nBut, with cost per hire (or CPH, as I\u2019ll refer to it from now on in this post) in particular, there\u2019s a problem. CPH is typically blended across ALL your hiring channels and is confined to recruiting spend alone. Computing one holistic CPH and confining it to just the recruiting team\u2019s spend hides problems with your funnel and doesn\u2019t help compare the quality of all your various candidate sources. And, most importantly, it completely overlooks arguably the most important thing of all \u2014 how much time your team is actually spending on hiring. **Drilling down further, engineering time, specifically, despite being one of the most expensive resources, isn\u2019t usually measured as part of the overall cost per hire.** Rather, it\u2019s generally written off as part of the cost of doing business. **The irony, of course, is that a typical interview process puts the recruiter call at the very beginning of the process precisely to save eng time, but if we don\u2019t measure eng time spent and quantify, then we can\u2019t really save it.**\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the Twitterverse (my followers are something like 50/50 engineers and recruiters) seems to agree. Here are the results (and some associated comments) of a poll I conducted on this very issue:\n\n> Quick poll! Should \"cost per hire\" calculations include engineering time spent on interviewing candidates?\n>\n> \u2014 Aline Lerner (@alinelernerLLC) [March 17, 2019](https://twitter.com/alinelernerLLC/status/1107073450013650944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nAnd yet, most of us don\u2019t do it. Why? Is it because it doesn\u2019t measure the things recruiters care about? Or is it because it\u2019s hard? Or is it because we can\u2019t change anything, so why bother? After all, engineers need to do interviews, both phone screens and onsites, and we already try to shield them as much as possible by having candidates chat with recruiters or do coding challenges first, so what else can you do?\n\n**If you\u2019d like to skip straight to how to compute a better, more inclusive CPH, you can skip down to our handy spreadsheet. Otherwise read on!**\n\nI\u2019ve worked as both an engineer and an in-house recruiter before founding interviewing.io, so I have the good fortune of having seen the limitations of measuring CPH, from both sides of the table. As such, in this post, I\u2019ll throw out two ways that we can make the cost per hire calculation more useful \u2014 by including eng time and by breaking it out by candidate source \u2014 and try to quantify exactly why these improvements are impactful\u2026 while building better rapport between recruiting and eng (where, real talk, relationships can be somewhat strained). But first, let\u2019s talk about how CPH is typically calculated.\n\n## How is CPH typically calculated, and why does it omit eng time?\n\nAs I called out above, the primary purpose of calculating cost per hire is to plan the recruiting department\u2019s budget for the next cycle. With that in mind, below is the formula that you\u2019ll find if you google how to calculate cost per hire (pulled from [Workable](https://resources.workable.com/tutorial/faq-recruitment-budget-metrics)):\n\n![A sketch outline of the cost per hire equation](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffc5ff_screenshot_2019_04_22_14_42_10_cdf4827348.webp&w=1920&q=75 \"The Cost per Hire equation\")\n\nTo figure out your CPH, you add up all the external and internal costs incurred during a recruiting cycle and divide by the number of hires.\n\n\u201cExternal\u201d refers to any money paid out to third parties. Examples include job boards, tools (e.g. sourcing, assessment, your ATS), agency fees, candidate travel and lodging, and recruiting events/career fairs.\n\n\u201cInternal\u201d refers to any money you spend within your company: recruiting team salaries, as well as any employee referral bonuses paid out over the course of the last cycle.\n\nNote that internal costs don\u2019t include eng salaries, as engineering and recruiting teams typically draw from different budgets. Hiring stuff is the domain of the recruiting team, and they pay for it out of their pockets\u2026 and engineers pay for\u2026 engineering stuff.\n\nWhat\u2019s problematic is that, while being called \u201ccost per hire\u201d this metric actually tells us what recruiting spends rather than what\u2019s actually being spent as a whole. While tracking recruiting spend makes sense for budget planning, this metric, because of its increasingly inaccurate name, often gets pulled into something it ironically wasn\u2019t intended for: figuring out how much the company is actually spending to make hires.\n\n## Why does factoring in engineering time matter?\n\nAs you saw above, not only is this the way we compute CPH inaccurate because it doesn\u2019t factor in any time or resource expenditure outside the recruiting team (with eng being the biggest one). But, does engineering time really matter?\n\nYes, it matters a lot, for the following three reasons:\n\n1. Way more eng time than recruiting time goes into hiring (as you\u2019ll see in this post!)\n2. Eng time is more expensive\n3. Eng time expenditure can vary wildly by channel\n\nTo establish that these things are (probably) true, let\u2019s look at a typical eng hiring funnel.[1](#user-content-fn-1) For the purposes of this exercise, we\u2019ll start the funnel at the recruiter screen and assume that the costs of sourcing candidates are fixed.[2](#user-content-fn-2)\n\n![Screenshot of the hiring funnels howing pass-through rates at each stage](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6c093_screenshot_2019_03_23_17_36_16_1_c18d98de26.webp&w=3840&q=75 \"The hiring funnel\")\n\nThe green arrows are conversion rates between each step (e.g. 50% of people who get offers accept and get hired). The small gray text at the bottom of each box is how long that step takes for an engineer or recruiter (or both, in the case of an onsite). And the black number is how many times that needs to happen to ultimately make 1 hire, based on the green-arrow conversion rates.\n\nSo, with that in mind, to make one hire, let\u2019s see how much time both eng and recruiting need to spend to make 1 hire and how much that time costs. Note that I\u2019m assuming $100/hour is a decent approximation for recruiting comp and $150/hour is a decent approximation for eng comp.\n\n## Is eng time spent on recruiting really that costly?\n\nBased on the funnel above, here\u2019s the breakdown of time spent by both engineering and recruiting to make 1 hire. The parentheticals next to each line of time spent are based on how long that step takes times the number of times it needs to happen.\n\n**RECRUITING \u2013 15 total hours**  \n**10** hours of recruiter screens (20 screens needed \\* 30 min per screen)  \n**4** hours of onsites (4 onsites needed \\* 1 hour per onsite)  \n**1** hour of offers (2 offer calls needed \\* 30 min per offer call)\n\nTo make 1 hire, it takes 15 recruiting hours or $1500.\n\n**ENGINEERING \u2013 40 total hours**  \n**16** hours of phone screens (16 screens needed \\* 1 hour per screen)  \n**24** hours of onsites (4 onsites needed \\* 6 hours per onsite)\n\nFor 1 hire, that\u2019s a total of 40 eng hours, and on the face of it, it\u2019s $6,000 of engineering time, but there is one more subtle multiplier on eng time that doesn\u2019t apply to recruiting time that we need to factor in. Every time you interrupt an engineer from their primary job, which is solving problems with code, it takes time to refocus and get back into it. If you\u2019re an engineer, you know this deep in your bones. And if you\u2019re not, interruptions are very likely something you\u2019ve heard your engineering friends decry\u2026 because they\u2019re so painful and detrimental to continued productivity. Back when I was writing code on a regular basis, it would take me 15 minutes of staring at my IDE (or, if I\u2019m honest, occasionally reading Hacker News or Reddit) to let my brain ease back into doing work after coming back from an interview. And it would take me 15 minutes before an interview to read a candidate\u2019s resume and get in the mindset of whatever coding or design question I was going to ask. I expect my time windows are pretty typical, so it basically ends up being a half hour of ramping up and back down for every hour spent interviewing.\n\nTherefore, with ramp-up and ramp-down time in mind, it\u2019s more like $9,000 in eng hours.[3](#user-content-fn-3)\n\n**Ultimately, for one hire, we\u2019re paying a total of $10,500, but eng incurs 6X the cost that recruiting does during the hiring process.**\n\n## Why does breaking out cost per hire by source matter?\n\nSo, hopefully, I\u2019ve convinced you that engineering time spent on hiring matters and that it\u2019s the biggest cost you incur. But, if there\u2019s nothing we can do to change it, and it\u2019s just the cost of doing business, then why factor it in to CPH calculations? **It turns out that eng time spent IS a lever you can pull, and its impact becomes clear when you think about cost per hire by candidate source.**\n\nTo make that more concrete, let\u2019s take a look at 2 examples. In both cases, we\u2019ll pretend that one of our candidate sources has a different conversion rate than the overall rate at some step in the funnel. Then we\u2019ll change up the conversion rate at one step in the funnel and try to guess that the financial implications of that are\u2026 and then actually calculate it. You might be surprised by the results.\n\n### What happens when you increase TPS to onsite conversion to 50%?\n\nAs you can see in the funnel above, a decent TPS to onsite conversion rate is 25%. Let\u2019s say one of your sources could double that to 50% (by doing more extensive top-of-funnel filtering, let\u2019s say). What do you think this will do to cost per hire?\n\nIn this model, we\u2019re spending a total of 10 recruiting hours (worth $1000) and 32 eng hours (worth $7200).[4](#user-content-fn-4) Unlike in the first example, we\u2019re now paying a total of $8200 to make a hire.\n\nIn this case, you\u2019ve reduced your recruiting time spent by 30% and your eng time spent by 20%, ultimately saving $2300 per hire. If one of your sources can get you this kind of efficiency gain, you probably want to invest more resources into it. And though doubling conversion from tech screen to onsite sounds great and perhaps something you would have known already about your source, without computing the cost per hire for this channel, it\u2019s not intuitively clear just how much money a funnel improvement can save you, end to end.\n\n### What happens when you cut your offer acceptance rate in half?\n\nAnother possibility is that one of your sources does pretty well when it comes to candidate quality all the way to offer, but for some reason, those candidates are twice as hard to close. In this scenario, you double both the eng and recruiting time expenditure and ultimately pay an extra $7500 per hire for this source (which you\u2019ll likely want to deallocate resources from here on out).[5](#user-content-fn-5)\n\nIn either of the examples above, until you break out CPH by source and see exactly what each is costing you, it\u2019s a lot harder to figure out how to optimize your spend.\n\n## How to actually measure cost per hire (and include eng time of course!)\n\nThe usual way to calculate cost per hire is definitely useful for setting recruiting budget, as we discussed above, but if you want to figure out how much your whole company is actually spending on hiring, you need to factor in the most expensive piece \u2014 engineering time.\n\nTo do this, we propose a different metric, one that\u2019s based on time spent by your team rather than overall salaries and fixed costs. Let\u2019s call it \u201ccost per hire prime\u201d or *CPH prime*.\n\nCPH prime doesn\u2019t factor in fixed costs like salaries or events, which you can still do using the formula above\u2026 but it is going to be instrumental in helping you get a handle on what your spend actually looks like and will help you compare different channels.\n\n**To make your life easier, we\u2019ve created a [handy spreadsheet for you to copy and then fill in your numbers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a3Oq1hkP9NfEbjU6pJiQEKCvLUzB9UTZOcqBxMiwDc0/edit#gid=0), like so**:\n\n![A spreadsheet calcuation of cost savings per hire](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F90740_screenshot_2019_04_24_09_50_29_3f7f158b1f.webp&w=1200&q=75 \"Calculating cost savings per hire\")\n\n=>As you can see, once you fill the highlighted cells with your own conversion numbers (and optionally your hourly wages if yours differ much from our guesses), we\u2019ll compute CPH prime for you.\n\nAnd because we\u2019re a business and want you to hire through us, we\u2019ve included the average savings for companies hiring through our platform. We provide two big value-adds: we can pretty drastically improve your TPS to onsite conversion \u2014 about 65% of our candidates pass the tech screen at companies on average. From there, they get offers and accept them at the same rate as you\u2019d see in your regular funnel.\n\n## Closing thoughts on building bridges between eng and recruiting\n\nSo, why does being cognizant of eng time in your CPH calculations matter? I\u2019ve already kind of beaten it into the ground that it\u2019s the biggest cost sink. However, there\u2019s another, more noble reason, to care about eng time. In my career, having sat on all different sides of the table, I\u2019ve noticed one unfortunate, inalienable truth: engineering and recruiting teams are simply not aligned.\n\nEngineers tend to harbor some resentment toward recruiters because recruiters are the arbiters of how eng spends their time when it comes to hiring without a set of clear metrics or goals that help protect that time.\n\nRecruiters often feel some amount of resentment toward engineers who tend to be resistant to interruptions, toward putting in the time to provide meaningful feedback about candidates so that recruiting can get better, and toward changes in the process.\n\nIn our humble opinion, much of the resentment on both sides could be cured by incorporating recruiting and engineering costs together in a specific, actionable way that will reduce the misalignment we\u2019re seeing. Recruiters tend to hold the cards when it comes to hiring practices, so we\u2019d love to see them take the lead to reach across the aisle by proactively factoring in eng time spent during hiring and ultimately incorporating recruiting and eng costs together in one metric that matters. Once that\u2019s in place, recruiting can use the data they gather to make better decisions about how to use eng time, and in the process, rebuild much of the rapport and love that\u2019s lost between the two departments.\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Table 1.\n\n**RECRUITING \u2013 15 total hours or $1500**\n\n- **5** hours of recruiter screens (10 screens needed \\* 30 min per screen)\n- **4** hours of onsites (4 onsites needed \\* 1 hour per onsite)\n- **1** hour of offers (2 offer calls needed \\* 30 min per offer call)  \n  **ENGINEERING \u2013 32 total hours or $7200**\n- **8** hours of phone screens (8 screens needed \\* 1 hour per screen)\n- **24** hours of onsites (4 onsites needed \\* 6 hours per onsite)\n\n### Table 2.\n\n**RECRUITING \u2013 30 total hours or $3000**\n\n- **20** hours of recruiter screens (40 screens needed \\* 30 min per screen)\n- **8** hours of onsites (8 onsites needed \\* 1 hour per onsite)\n- **2** hours of offers (4 offer calls needed \\* 30 min per offer call)  \n  **ENGINEERING \u2013 80 total hours or $18,000**\n- **32** hours of phone screens (32 screens needed \\* 1 hour per screen)\n- **48** hours of onsites (8 onsites needed \\* 6 hours per onsite)\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. We\u2019re basing these numbers on a mix of ATS reporting ([Lever\u2019s recruiting metrics report](https://www.lever.co/resources/recruiting-metrics-for-startups-and-smbs-report/) in particular) and what we\u2019ve heard from our customers. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n2. We\u2019re assuming sourcing costs are fixed for purposes of simplicity and because this post is largely about the importance of eng time factored in to the funnel. Of course, if you have channels that reduce sourcing time significantly, you\u2019ll want to weigh that when deciding its efficacy. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-2)\n3. Really though, the value of an hour of work for an engineer is intangible and much higher than an hourly wage. There ARE inefficiencies and overhead to having a larger staff, not every hour is effective, and most likely it\u2019s your best people who are conducting interviews. The reality is that the money spent on salaries is probably only a fraction of the true cost to the company, particularly for engineers (as opposed to recruiters). [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-3)\n4. See *Appendix: Table 1* for our work in figuring out how much recruiting and eng time it takes to make a hire when your TPS to onsite conversion rate is 50%. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-4)\n5. See *Appendix: Table 2* for our work in figuring out how much recruiting and eng time it takes to make a hire when you cut your offer acceptance rate in half.

What better, fairer way to evaluate someone\u2019s ability to do the work\u2026 than to have them do the work?\n\nUnfortunately, in practice, take-homes typically suck for engineers.\n\nWe surveyed almost 700 of our users about their experiences with take-homes and interviewed a handful more for deeper insights. We learned a lot\u2014mostly about candidates' poor experiences and negative feelings toward take-homes. They take a lot of time. They don\u2019t respect candidates\u2019 time. Candidates often get no feedback. And candidates are almost never compensated.\n\nThe good news? Turns out there are some pretty simple things companies can do to vastly improve their take-home assignments. But before we dive into that\u2026\n\n## Why do companies use take-home assignments?\n\nTake-homes vary a ton by role and company in terms of the types of questions, subject matter, length, and intensity. At their simplest, take-homes can be the same questions as in an algorithmic interview, except done asynchronously. The other extreme is asking candidates to build an entire app and deploy it.\n\nWe were surprised to see how often companies use take-homes. About 85% of our users got one at some point in their career, independent of their experience level. Of the users who encountered them, they tended to see them as part of the process about 20% of the time, again, independent of their experience level[1](#user-content-fn-1).\n\nWhy are take-homes relatively popular among employers? They mostly use them to save time in the hiring process. There are, however, some more noble reasons a company might use a take-home assignment:\n\n- Get better signal during the interview process, as a take-home can be more indicative of actual work\n- Get a candidate's best work out of them in a lower-stress environment than a live algorithmic interview and/or attract candidates who don\u2019t like algorithmic interviews (of which there are [plenty](https://hn.algolia.com/?q=coding+interviews))\n- Broaden the candidate pool by offering a way in for candidates from non-traditional backgrounds\u2014in lieu of a resume screen, which they\u2019d likely fail, candidates can do choose to do an assignment\n\nAccordingly, here\u2019s the relevant part of a great conversation between Vincent Woo of CoderPad and Patrick McKenzie (known to Hacker News folks as patio11) of Stripe, formerly of [Starfighter](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2015/03/09/announcing-starfighter/).\n\nVincent: *What general sort of high level change do you think that recruiters at tech\ncompanies that are roughly Stripe\u2019s size or bigger ought to make?*\n\nPatrick: *If I could wave a magic wand and sell the world on one concept, it would be selling the world on the desirability of work sample testing\u2026 where the way to tell if someone is good at something is to have them do the something.*\n\nDespite enthusiasm for the theory of take-homes and some very well-intentioned reasons, candidates overwhelmingly don\u2019t like take-homes. Here\u2019s why.\n\n## Why don\u2019t candidates like take-homes? It\u2019s about value asymmetry.\n\n**Though users expressed a lot of frustration with take-homes, we were surprised to see very few take a hard-line stance and refuse to do them. Only 6% outright refuse, and 66% of people complete take-homes all or most of the time.** Surprisingly, these stats didn\u2019t really change when we looked only at senior engineers. I was expecting that experienced engineers would do them almost never, if at all, but that\u2019s not what the data shows. It\u2019s possible that seniors are just louder in their disapproval.\n\n![How often people do take-homes.png](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/How_often_people_do_take_homes_e85d712b9b.png)\n\nNevertheless, the more desirable a company, the more likely candidates will do the take-home and feel OK about it\u201470% told us they completed them because they \u201cReally wanted to work at the company and were willing to do what it took.\u201d\n\n> *I found Weedmaps [to be] a very interesting company. They were the first marijuana related company to IPO. So you'd be on the frontier working for them. I found that exciting. So I applied and they had [a] take-home. I was like, sure, of course I\u2019ll do this.*\n\nOther reasons our users gave for completion included: \u201cBecause the take-home would be discussed at the onsite\u201d (38%) and \u201cInteresting/cool assignment\u201d (37%). However, many of those who did finish them had such a poor experience that they said they\u2019d never apply to certain companies ever again. We\u2019ll talk about what makes the experience poor in a little bit.\n\nOf the people who refused to do at least one take-home at some point in their career, here were their reasons.\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FWhy_people_don_t_do_take_homes_f138c44568.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nNumbers don\u2019t add up to 100 because it was a multi-select poll. In addition, we obviously don\u2019t know how often take-homes are boring or unclear in the wild (probably often!), nor do we know how often companies pay people to do them (our guess, based on some napkin math, is >10% of the time). So we don\u2019t have the true denominator for these stats. Nevertheless, we found these results insightful.\n\n**The common thread among all of these reasons is value asymmetry.** The worst take-homes feel unrewarding to candidates. Even exploitative. Take-home assignments ask a lot of candidates: a significant investment of their time, with an often unclear scope, no guarantee of progressing to the next round, often without feedback, and almost always without compensation. Meanwhile, the company has basically invested nothing, except to send the task. We heard this a lot.\n\n> *When I'm interviewing, I look for things that are proxies for valuing team members\u2026 or not. If they want me to do a take-home test, and they haven't even spent 30 minutes on a phone screen, I begin to sense an asymmetry in our relationship, with their time and resources being very valuable, and mine not being valuable at all.*\n\n> *A divergence between how much effort they want me to put in, and how much they want to put in themselves. It signals that they are more worried about their time than mine, their costs than mine. It also means they underestimate how much effort it takes to write code, so that if I go to work for them, I am likely to face demands to work uncompensated overtime to meet their optimistic estimates.*\n\n> *Spending five hours on their one-hour test for nothing leaves hard feelings. And if they ghost me after the test, I will happily tell every developer who asks what cheapskates they are.*\n\n## Is there any relationship between who candidates are and their willingness to do take-homes?\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, our data says no. We ran a regression to compare our survey respondents\u2019 interview performance on our platform to how likely they were to do take-homes. The relationship was so weak as to be negligible.\n\nSimilarly, we ran a regression to see if people who *look* good on paper are more or less likely to do take-homes. The relationship there was negligible as well.\n\nIn other words, contrary to some popular opinions, you\u2019re not necessarily weeding out your best candidates by doing take-homes, whether you define \u201cbest\u201d in terms of how their resume looks or how they perform in interviews.\n\n## How companies can make take-homes better (and why they probably should)\n\nAfter reading the stats above, you might think that, despite their grumblings, candidates generally do take-homes, and the best candidates won\u2019t be weeded out. So, if you\u2019re one of the many companies that uses them, it may not make sense to invest your limited time into making them better. It\u2019s not that simple. For some companies, like the FAANGs, who have extremely strong brands and are known to pay well, changes are probably not worth it, especially in this market, where junior and senior engineers are willing to jump through more hoops than ever before.\n\nIf you\u2019re not a FAANG, though, listen up. Here are some questions you can ask yourself to figure out if you should indeed make some changes to your take-homes.\n\n**First, take an honest look in the mirror and ask yourself about your brand strength. Are you a household name? Does having you on candidates\u2019 resumes give them automatic prestige? Are you known to pay above market?** If the answer to *all* of these questions isn\u2019t a resounding yes, your brand strength is probably not strong enough to make people jump through hoops.\n\nHere\u2019s a sketch to drive that point home. Unless you have a ton of brand strength, candidates\u2019 willingness to jump through hoops drops off sharply.\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrand_strength_vs_value_asymmetry_4bc96b83d4.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nIn fairness, I drew this sketch in a boom market. Maybe it\u2019s a bit less steep now, but honestly, I\u2019m not sure.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t maxing out on brand strength, there are two questions you should ask yourself:\n\n1. What is my take-home completion rate?\n2. What is my offer acceptance rate?\n\n**If your completion rate is below, say, 60% (our data shows that candidates complete take-homes around 62% of the time), then it\u2019s DEFINITELY time to make a change.** Honestly, regardless of what our data says, if people aren\u2019t completing them at least 85% of the time, it\u2019s *probably* time to make a change\u2014losing more than 15% of your candidates to attrition at any given stage in the funnel is bad.\n\n**What about your offer acceptance rate? If it\u2019s less than 50% and you\u2019re using a take-home already, there\u2019s an opportunity to make some improvements.** You might be wondering what this has to do with take-homes in the first place. To answer that, let\u2019s change how we think about different parts of the interview process. At face value, every part of the process is there to vet candidates, to determine if they\u2019re the right fit for your organization. However, when used correctly, every part of your process should become a selling vehicle as well. This is *especially* important for companies who do not have a strong, well-known brand. The FAANGs can get away with using their interview processes primarily as vetting exercises because candidates are already sold on the pay or prestige or sometimes on the work and the product. When you don\u2019t have an established brand, the candidates who come to you are, at best, open to learning more, and the interview process is the instrument that teaches them. Wield it accordingly.\n\nThough we strongly advocate coming up with [great, unique interview questions](https://interviewing.io/blog/best-technical-interviews-common)[2](#user-content-fn-2) and making sure you have [great interviewers](https://interviewing.io/blog/we-have-the-best-technical-interviewers-heres-how-we-do-it), if your process does have a take-home component, it is one of the more overlooked parts of the process when it comes to selling. You have the opportunity to have someone *do the actual work that you do*! This is your chance to pick the coolest stuff you\u2019ve worked on and serve it up to someone on a platter and make it stick in their brains and make them imagine what it\u2019d be like to work on these kinds of problems every day! Why wouldn\u2019t you jump at this opportunity?\n\nYou may think you don\u2019t need to sell in this market. But just because employers have all the power right now, it doesn\u2019t mean that will always be the case. And great senior engineers still have a lot of leverage.\n\nIf, after considering your take-home completion rate and your offer acceptance rate, it looks like you *do* need to make some changes, here are some practical tips, based on what we\u2019ve learned from talking to our users (overwhelmingly senior engineers who are targeting top-tier companies\u2014probably the people you want). Let\u2019s start with what we just talked about: using the take-home as a selling vehicle.\n\n### Make them interesting and relevant to the actual work\n\nYou're getting a chance to spend a couple of hours with somebody in a take-home (metaphorically). Why wouldn't you do everything you can to get them excited? **Pick a problem that you've worked on, and get them hooked on it. Pick the kernel of an interesting problem that you've solved, and build something around it that will challenge candidates. Something that gets them thinking, \u201cI could have done that better\u201d or \u201cThis is a different or more efficient way to do it.\u201d That's going to be more effective than the standard perks many companies offer.**\n\n> *[Best take-home I\u2019ve seen was an] open-ended system design question on the type of system I would work on, was meant to simulate a team discussion on the system we needed to build, and was a great way for me to start thinking about what I'd be working on there.*\n\nOne way you could do this, is to have your engineering team keep a shared doc of \u2018cool\u2019 solutions they've found, or new things they've tried. These can serve as jumping-off points for creating your take-homes.\n\n> *The\u2026 challenge was for an internal tooling team that specialized in incident response tools; their challenge was to create a scaled down version of a tool already in use at the company. The focus was more on understanding the domain and customer than wiring up a bunch of complicated stuff, and it was a delight. It being a greenfield also gave you an opportunity to showcase some software design skills. I did not get this job, but enjoyed the experience and still feel connected to the team.*\n\n> *It was conceptually related to the sort of work the team was performing, but it was simplified and stand-alone enough to clearly not be unpaid labor for their product.*\n\nJust be sure that when you come up with a practical problem that you strip out the annoying parts and focus only on the juicy kernel of the problem, the part that\u2019s actually cool and lets the candidate be smart and creative. Don\u2019t make them do grunt work or wrestle with their dev environment!\n\n> *[This] was for a tooling team in Support, where they didn't have a lot of experience creating challenges or interviewing. One of the engineers took a difficult task that he had accomplished recently and just made that the take home challenge. It involved a lot of Ruby version conflict debugging. It was completely demoralizing and felt like hazing.*\n\n### Keep them short\n\nCandidates overwhelmingly favor take-homes that respect their time, i.e., short ones.\n\n> *The best were short and brief, took no more than 2 hours and were directly related to what I would be doing on the job.*\n\n> *Best are realistic and time bound, i.e., low time investment required.*\n\n> *Short and quick take-homes are great.*\n\n**Over 80% of survey respondents said that take-homes should take 4 hours or less, and a plurality thought that they should take 2 hours.**\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FHow_long_engineers_think_take_home_assignments_should_take_2a361d8e29.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nThe outliers are interesting. Unfortunately, we missed an opportunity to ask about those in the survey.\n\nTake-homes being short in theory is one thing\u2026 but we got a lot of feedback that take-homes often go far beyond how long companies tell candidates that take-homes should take.\n\n#### Have someone on your team QA the actual length of the assignment\n\nThis disconnect between actual time and expected time is another instance of value asymmetry: companies didn't even bother to have someone on their team do the take-home themselves and time it.\n\n> *I've done a couple of algorithm questions as take-homes that the interviewer said should take an hour. They routinely take longer than that.*\n\n> *Companies will say, \u2018don\u2019t spend more than X hours on it,\u2019 but then it actually takes 5X that amount. It's just too much time. And most of the time they didn\u2019t give feedback at all even though I spent so much time on it.*\n\nCompanies should clearly communicate the expected time commitment for a take-home. And they should be realistic about how much time it should take.\n\n> *Best was an interesting problem with a realistic time frame. They estimated 2 hours and it took me exactly that, which was refreshing and made the process seem fair.*\n\n> *I've done a couple of exercises where they were truly respectful of my time. The tasks were small, clearly defined, and they gave me a realistic timeframe to complete them.*\n\n> *For the best take-home I did, the company told me: \u2018Tell us when you're going to start, and you'll have 4 hours. We'll be available over email that whole time, and we'll answer your questions within minutes.\u2019 That felt respectful of my time, and was a more reliable signal of my capabilities than a 20-minute algorithms exercise.*\n\n**To get a realistic estimate, companies could simply QA their own take-homes\u2014just by having someone on your team take it, and time them.**\n\nStill, some candidates will spend more time anyway, because they really want to work for a certain company. And it can be easy for candidates to go down a rabbit hole and get most of a take-home done in the first few hours, then spend another day or more, perfecting it to give themselves a better chance.\n\n> *Do you want me to literally only work two hours on something that's clearly going to take 10 to really be able to have a conversation with you about how I think about things? Because two hours of decisions isn't as good as 10 hours of decisions.*\n\nIt\u2019s okay if candidates want to put in extra time, but it should be made clear that that's not the expectation.\n\n### Set a clear scope, related to the role\n\n> *The scope was poorly defined, which made the assignment not only tedious, but also seemed like a waste of time.*\n\n**Having clear, straightforward instructions can significantly enhance the take-home experience for candidates, making them feel purposeful and relevant. The best take-homes are those that directly align with the actual job.** When candidates are asked to solve a simplified version of a real problem your company is facing, it not only tests relevant skills, but also gives a candidate insight into what work at your company would be like, which is really what selling is. (This is, of course, assuming that you believe what you\u2019re working on is cool\u2026 If you don\u2019t, how will you ever convince others?)\n\n> *One was a great learning experience because I had to solve a problem similar to what I would face in the job. It was concise and focused.*\n\nBeing able to ask questions before or during the take-home, e.g., having a direct contact point who\u2019s an engineer at the company, can also be a big plus.\n\n### Be thoughtful about where in your process you insert the take-home, and give candidates a choice between a take-home and something else\n\n#### For take-homes early in the process, before speaking to a human\n\nWe expect that many of the companies reading this piece have take-homes as the first step in\ntheir process, before ever talking to a human. This decision isn\u2019t very popular.\n\n> *If a company calls me for a screening interview, it means they've read my resume and cover letter, and not immediately dismissed my application as inappropriate. It also means they're putting a person on a phone call with me for the duration of the screening interview. This is symmetric, my effort matches theirs.*\n\n> *[I] did a take home that was automatically sent to me after applying, before even speaking to a human. The feedback was 'you are too expensive,' no feedback on the coding.*\n\n> *Company needs to build an investment with the candidate first\u2014they shouldn't ask for it before meeting the candidate at least once.*\n\n**That said, take-homes can be a great way to let candidates who don\u2019t look good on paper show what they can do, and those candidates are more likely to complete them.** To prevent candidate unhappiness/attrition, give them a choice. Either submit a resume or do the take-home assignment or both. If you go this route, though, design a take-home that you trust. We\u2019ve seen companies take this approach and then throw out perfect-scoring take-homes when they didn\u2019t like the resume. If you use a take-home, then respect your candidates enough to follow up with the ones who\u2019ve done well, even if they don\u2019t look good on paper.\n\n#### For take-homes later in the process\n\n**Another way to make take-homes purposeful is to give your candidates an explicit choice about whether they\u2019d rather do a technical interview or a take-home.** Engineers are, in fact, split on which they\u2019d prefer. Giving them a choice allows them to showcase their skills in the format they prefer and feel best prepared for. If you have good questions, you should be able to get good signal from either.\n\nOnly 10% of respondents told us that they were given the choice of take-home versus technical interview. So there is an opportunity for more companies to do this. It's a candidate-friendly gesture that shows empathy and can help candidates shine.\n\nMany candidates have spent months preparing for standard technical interviews. So it can feel anticlimactic when they find out that a company they're excited about doesn't do them. Others get so nervous in a live interview that they don\u2019t perform.\n\n> *I rarely don't pass take-home assessments, but I often fail to pass live interviews.*\n\nInterestingly, one user we interviewed told us that they spend far less time on a take-home compared to preparing for a live technical interview. And because of that they prefer take-homes.\n\n> *I prefer take-homes over all other assessments because I find I spend far less time on take-homes then I do preparing for live interviews. It's hard to overestimate the amount of extra time I spend preparing for a technical interview, compared to doing a take-home\u2014for me it\u2019s maybe 10 times as much. I've spent hundreds of hours, maybe 500 hours, over the course of my career preparing for technical interviews. And if I have one pop up, I can't just drop everything and do it right away. I have to spend a lot of extra time just ramping up for a particular interview, in addition to the hundreds of hours that I've done.*\n\n### Give candidates a good, rational reason to do the take-home\n\nClear communication about the purpose of a take-home in the hiring process, as well as why it\u2019s rational to spend time on it, is important for candidates. It\u2019s a way to make sure it feels purposeful and not like a random task.\n\nOne way to make the take-home feel deliberate is to replace some parts of your process with it. A standard process without a take-home has a recruiter call followed by a technical phone screen followed by an onsite (virtual or otherwise). The technical phone screen usually lasts about an hour. The onsite usually lasts 6 hours.\n\nLet\u2019s say your take-home takes 2 hours to do. You can make it replace the phone screen and one of the onsite rounds, which nets out to the same number of hours spent. If you go this route, we recommend doing the math *explicitly* for candidates and showing them that the time they spend on the take-home is equivalent to the time they\u2019d be spending on a process without it.\n\nAnother way to make the take-home feel deliberate is to incorporate it into the onsite, where at least one of the rounds, if not more, will include a code review and/or thoughtful discussion about tradeoffs and choices made. This should be standard practice, but isn\u2019t always. 32% of our users said companies had told them this, and it was the reason they decided to do a take-home.\n\n> *The best take-homes were ones that we discussed in the first rounds of interviews. The worst ones were ones that I submitted and we never talked about them again.*\n\n**Ideally, you do both of these things together, and very clearly explain to candidates both the math and how the take-home informs the content of the onsite.**\n\n### Compensate candidates\n\nProbably the most striking result of our survey was that 58% of candidates think that they deserve compensation for completing take-homes. Yet only 4% reported ever receiving it. Compensation can shift candidate perceptions of the hiring process and of the company:\n\n> *They compensated me for my time, which made the process feel very professional and respectful.*\n\n> *It was a completely open source codebase and so their process was the exact same as someone that was an employee: here's the ticket with the information to do it, set up the environment, download all the code, get everything running. They gave me a few different tasks I could choose from, I could pick two, and if I completed them I would be compensated a fixed rate, which was $100 for each task. Which in terms of the time I spent on it, is still really cheap for them.*\n\nIf candidates know they\u2019re going to be paid for their work on a take-home, they\u2019ll be more likely to complete it as well.\nCompensating candidates is a clear gesture that shows you value their time and effort, that there\u2019s more symmetry in the relationship. It also goes hand-in-hand with time: paying also forces a company to scope the take-home to a reasonable number of hours. So it's a forcing function for good behavior\u2014if you can\u2019t afford much, then don't make the take-home too long!\n\n#### How much to pay?\n\nResponses about how much companies should pay for take-home assignments were split.\n\n1. **Fixed amounts**: Just over half of respondents (52%) suggested specific and reasonable fixed amounts, ranging from $50 to $500.\n2. **Hourly rates**: The other almost half (47%) favored an hourly rate, with suggestions ranging from $50 an hour and upward (average of $217 an hour). Some suggested that the rate should correspond to the salary of the position being applied for, or be comparable to what an employee at that level and company would earn. As one user put it:\n\n   > *Maybe just pay market?*\n\n   One antipattern when it comes to comp is NOT having a set rate, asking the candidate to name their price, and thereby putting the candidate in a position where they feel like they need to negotiate. In this scenario, the candidate has to negotiate twice: once on the take-home and once on their actual comp, with the worry that negotiating too aggressively on the take-home might count them out\u2026 or not aggressively enough anchoring the company to lower compensation down the line. No one needs these mind-games in an already stressful process. Just have a set rate, for god\u2019s sake.\n3. **Symbolic compensation**: This is probably not the best option, but a handful of survey respondents (1%) did mention that a minimal symbolic compensation would do. While 1% is small, we found this interesting to include because, when we interviewed people, two of them mentioned this.\n\n   > *I think any compensation at all has symbolic value. A $100 Amazon card would impress me. A $50 Amazon card and a company t-shirt would at least not insult me. It\u2019s kind of a consolation prize to say, \u2018No hard feelings.\u2019*\n\n   > *I feel like a couple meal vouchers would do it these days.*\n\n**Of these options, we\u2019d recommend a reasonable fixed amount based on the task, and the actual time it\u2019s supposed to take.** And of course you know how long it takes because you had one of your engineers do it themselves, right? Right??\n\n### Give feedback\n\n**Lack of feedback was the primary reason our survey respondents said their experience with a given company was bad.** Regardless of interview type, we\u2019re always [pro feedback](https://interviewing.io/blog/why-giving-feedback-good-or-bad-will-help-you-hire), but feedback is especially important for take-homes, because in a way they ask more of a candidate. Offering constructive feedback, regardless of the hiring decision, respects the candidate's effort on the take-home.\n\nDespite the time and effort they invested in completing take-homes, many of our survey respondents said they received no feedback at all. This was seen as demoralizing, and it deterred candidates from applying to future opportunities at those companies.\n\n> *Getting rejected without having a chance to discuss the code with anyone is a terrible experience.*\n\n> *It is really discouraging spending a large amount of time to find out you are rejected without explanations.*\n\n> *They provided no feedback after submission, which made the whole effort feel unappreciated and one-sided.*\n\nIncidentally, the main reason companies don\u2019t give feedback is fear of getting sued. As it turns out, [literally ZERO companies (at least in the US) have ever been sued by an engineer](https://interviewing.io/blog/no-engineer-has-ever-sued-a-company-because-of-constructive-post-interview-feedback-so-why-dont-employers-do-it) who received constructive post-interview feedback.\n\n*Thanks to [Dan Fennessy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielfennessy/) for all the behind-the-scenes work on this post.*\n\nFootnotes:\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1.

Even with increased effort and resources poured into diversity hiring programs, Facebook\u2019s headcount for women and people of color hasn\u2019t really increased in the past 3 years. Google\u2019s numbers have looked remarkably similar, and both players have yet to make significant impact in the space, despite a number of initiatives spanning everything from a [points system rewarding recruiters for bringing in candidates](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-point-system-fails-to-close-diversity-gap-1471387288) from diverse backgrounds, to increased funding for tech education, to efforts to hire more candidates from diverse backgrounds in key leadership positions.\n\nWhy have gains in diversity hiring been so lackluster across the board?\n\nFacebook justifies these disappointing numbers by citing the ubiquitous [pipeline problem](https://interviewing.io/blog/we-ran-the-numbers-and-there-really-is-a-pipeline-problem-in-eng-hiring), namely that not enough people from underrepresented groups have access to the education and resources they need to be set up for success. And Google\u2019s take appears to be similar, judging from what portion of their diversity-themed, forward-looking investments are [focused on education](https://time.com/3849218/google-diversity-investment/).\n\nIn addition to blaming the pipeline, since Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s announcements, a growing flurry of conversations have loudly waxed causal about the *real* reason diversity hiring efforts haven\u2019t worked. These have included everything from how diversity training isn\u2019t sticky enough, to how work environments remain exclusionary and thereby unappealing to diverse candidates, to improper calibration of performance reviews to not accounting for how marginalized groups actually respond to diversity-themed messaging.\n\nWhile we are excited that more resources are being allocated to education and inclusive workplaces, at [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/), we posit another reason for why [diversity hiring initiatives aren\u2019t working](https://interviewing.io/blog/diversity-hiring-initiatives-wrong). **After drawing on data from thousands of technical interviews, it\u2019s become clear to us that technical interviewing is a process whose results are nondeterministic and often arbitrary. We believe that technical interviewing is a broken process for everyone but that the flaws within the system hit underrepresented groups the hardest\u2026 because they haven\u2019t had the chance to internalize just how much of technical interviewing is a numbers game.** Getting a few interview invites here and there through increased diversity initiatives isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s a beginning, but it\u2019s not enough. It takes a lot of interviews to get used to the process and the format and to understand that the stuff you do in technical interviews isn\u2019t actually the stuff you do at work every day. And it takes people in your social circle all going through the same experience, screwing up interviews here and there, and getting back on the horse to realize that poor performance in one interview isn\u2019t predictive of whether you\u2019ll be a good engineer.\n\n## A brief history of technical interviewing\n\nA definitive work on the history of technical interviewing was surprisingly hard to find, but I was able to piece together a narrative by scouring books like [How Would You Move Mount Fuji](https://www.amazon.com/How-Would-Move-Mount-Fuji/dp/0316778494), [Programming Interviews Exposed](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Secrets-Landing/dp/1118261364/), and the bounty of the internets. The story goes something like this.\n\nTechnical interviewing has its roots as far back as 1950s Palo Alto, at Shockley Semiconductor Laboratories. Shockley\u2019s interviewing methodology came out of a need to separate the innovative, rapidly moving, Cold War-fueled tech space from hiring approaches taken in more traditionally established, skills-based assembly-line based industry. And so, he relied on questions that could gauge analytical ability, intellect, and potential quickly. One canonical question in this category has to do with coins. You have 8 identical-looking coins, except one is lighter than the rest. Figure out which one it is with just two weighings on a pan balance.\n\nThe techniques that Shockley developed were adapted by Microsoft during the 90s, as the first dot-com boom spurred an explosion in tech hiring. As with the constraints imposed by both the volume and the high analytical/adaptability bar imposed by Shockley, Microsoft, too, needed to vet people quickly for potential \u2014 as software engineering became increasingly complex over the course of the dot-com boom, it was no longer possible to have a few centralized \u201cmaster programmers\u201d manage the design and then delegate away the minutiae. Even rank and file developers needed to be able to produce under a variety of rapidly evolving conditions, where just mastery of specific skills wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nThe puzzle format, in particular, was easy to standardize because individual hiring managers didn\u2019t have to come up with their own interview questions, and a company could quickly build up its own interchangeable question repository.\n\nThis mentality also applied to the interview process itself \u2014 rather than having individual teams run their own processes and pipelines, it made much more sense to standardize things. This way, in addition to questions, you could effectively plug and play the interviewers themselves \u2014 any interviewer within your org could be quickly trained up and assigned to speak with any candidate, independent of prospective team.\n\nPuzzle questions were a good solution for this era for a different reason. Collaborative editing of documents didn\u2019t become a thing until Google Docs\u2019 launch in 2007. Without that capability, writing code in a phone interview was untenable \u2014 if you\u2019ve ever tried to talk someone through how to code something up without at least a shared piece of paper in front of you, you know how painful it can be. In the absence of being able to write code in front of someone, the puzzle question was a decent proxy. Technology marched on, however, and its evolution made it possible to move from the proxy of puzzles to more concrete, coding-based interview questions. Around the same time, [Google itself publicly overturned the efficacy of puzzle questions](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html).\n\nSo where does this leave us? **Technical interviews are moving in the direction of more concreteness, but they are still very much a proxy for the day-to-day work that a software engineer actually does. The hope was that the proxy would be decent enough, but it was always understood that that\u2019s what they were and that the cost-benefit of relying on a proxy worked out in cases where problem solving trumped specific skills and where the need for scale trumped everything else.**\n\nAs it happens, elevating problem-solving ability and the need for a scalable process are both eminently reasonable motivations. But here\u2019s the unfortunate part: the second reason, namely the need for scalability, doesn\u2019t apply in most cases. Very few companies are large enough to need plug and play interviewers. But coming up with interview questions and processes is really hard, so despite their differing needs, smaller companies often take their cues from the larger players, not realizing that companies like Google are successful at hiring because the work they do attracts an assembly line of smart, capable people\u2026 and that their success at hiring is often despite their hiring process and not because of it. **So you end up with a de facto interviewing cargo cult, where smaller players blindly mimic the actions of their large counterparts and blindly hope for the same results.**\n\n**The worst part is that these results may not even be repeatable\u2026** for anyone. To show you what I mean, I\u2019ll talk a bit about some data we collected at interviewing.io.\n\n## Technical interviewing is broken for everybody\n\n### Interview outcomes are kind of arbitrary\n\ninterviewing.io is a platform where people can practice technical interviewing anonymously and, in the process, find jobs. Interviewers and interviewees meet in a collaborative coding environment and jump right into a technical interview question. After each interview, both sides rate one another, and interviewers rate interviewees on their technical ability. And the same interviewee can do multiple interviews, each of which is with a different interviewer and/or different company, and this opens the door for some interesting and somewhat controlled comparative analysis.\n\nWe were curious to see how consistent the same interviewee\u2019s performance was from interview to interview, so we dug into our data. After looking at thousands of interviews on the platform, we\u2019ve discovered something alarming: **[interviewee performance from interview to interview varied quite a bit, even for people with a high average performance](https://interviewing.io/blog/after-a-lot-more-data-technical-interview-performance-really-is-kind-of-arbitrary)**. In the graph below, every represents the mean technical score for an individual interviewee who has done 2 or more interviews on interviewing.io. The y-axis is standard deviation of performance, so the higher up you go, the more volatile interview performance becomes.\n\n![Screen-Shot-2021-01-19-at-7.04.20-PM.png](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Screen_Shot_2021_01_19_at_7_04_20_PM_f6010739c4.png)\n\nAs you can see, roughly 25% of interviewees are consistent in their performance, but the rest are all over the place. And over a third of people with a high mean (>=3) technical performance bombed at least one interview.\n\nDespite the noise, from the graph above, you can make some guesses about which people you\u2019d want to interview. However, keep in mind that each person above represents a mean. Let\u2019s pretend that, instead, you had to make a decision based on just one data point. That\u2019s where things get dicey. **Looking at this data, it\u2019s not hard to see why technical interviewing is often perceived as a game.** And, unfortunately, it\u2019s a game where people often can\u2019t tell how they\u2019re doing.\n\n### No one can tell how they\u2019re doing\n\nI mentioned above that on interviewing.io, we collect post-interview feedback. In addition to asking interviewers how their candidates did, we also ask interviewees how they think they did. Comparing those numbers for each interview showed us something really surprising: people are terrible at gauging their own interview performance, and impostor syndrome is particularly prevalent. In fact, **[people underestimate their performance over twice as often as they overestimate it](https://interviewing.io/blog/own-interview-performance)**. Take a look at the graph below to see what I mean:\n\n**Note that, in our data, impostor syndrome knows no gender or pedigree \u2014 it hits engineers on our platform across the board, regardless of who they are or where they come from.**\n\nNow here\u2019s the messed up part. During the feedback step that happens after each interview, we ask interviewees if they\u2019d want to work with their interviewer. As it turns out, there\u2019s a very strong relationship between whether people think they did well and whether they would indeed want to work with the interviewer \u2014 **when people think they did poorly, even if they actually didn\u2019t, they may be a lot less likely to want to work with you**. And, by extension, it means that in every interview cycle, some portion of interviewees are losing interest in joining your company just because they didn\u2019t think they did well, despite the fact that they actually did.\n\n**As a result, companies are losing candidates from all walks of life because of a fundamental flaw in the process.**\n\n### Poor performances hit marginalized groups the hardest\n\nThough impostor syndrome appears to hit engineers from all walks of life, we\u2019ve found that women get hit the hardest in the face of an actually poor performance. As we learned above, **poor performances in technical interviewing happen to most people, even people who are generally very strong. However, when we looked at our data, we discovered that after a poor performance, [women are 7 times more likely to stop practicing than men](https://interviewing.io/blog/voice-modulation-gender-technical-interviews)**:\n\nA [bevy of research appears to support confidence-based attrition as a very real cause for women departing from STEM fields](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/), but I would expect that the implications of the attrition we witnessed extend beyond women to underrepresented groups, across the board.\n\n## What the real problem is\n\n**At the end of the day, because technical interviewing is indeed a game, like all games, it takes practice to improve. However, unless you\u2019ve been socialized to expect and be prepared for the game-like aspect of the experience, it\u2019s not something that you can necessarily intuit.** And if you go into your interviews expecting them to be indicative of your aptitude at the job, which is, at the outset, not an unreasonable assumption, you will be crushed the first time you crash and burn. But the process isn\u2019t a great or predictable indicator of your aptitude. And on top of that, you likely can\u2019t tell how you\u2019re doing even when you do well.\n\n**These are issues that everyone who\u2019s gone through the technical interviewing gauntlet has grappled with. But not everyone has the wherewithal or social support to realize that the process is imperfect and to stick with it. And the less people like you are involved, whether it\u2019s because they\u2019re not the same color as you or the same gender or because not a lot of people at your school study computer science or because you\u2019re a dropout or for any number of other reasons, the less support or insider knowledge or 10,000 foot view of the situation you\u2019ll have.** Full stop.\n\n## Inclusion and education isn\u2019t enough\n\nTo help remedy the lack of diversity in its headcount, [Facebook has committed to three actionable steps](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/07/facebook-diversity-update-positive-hiring-trends-show-progress/) on varying time frames. The first step revolves around creating a more inclusive interview/work environment for existing candidates. The other two are focused on addressing the perceived pipeline problem in tech:\n\n- Short Term: Building a Diverse Slate of Candidates and an Inclusive Working Environment\n- Medium Term: Supporting Students with an Interest in Tech\n- Long Term: Creating Opportunity and Access\n\nIndeed, efforts to promote inclusiveness and increased funding for education are extremely noble, especially in the face of potentially not being able to see results for years in the case of the latter. However, both take a narrow view of the problem and both continue to funnel candidates into a broken system.\n\nErica Baker really cuts to the heart of it in [her blog post about Twitter hiring a head of D&I](https://medium.com/this-is-hard/wrong-acacd043229b#.cf3iajdvn):\n\n> *\u201cWhat irks me the most about this is that no company, Twitter or otherwise, should have a VP of Diversity and Inclusion. When the VP of Engineering\u2026 is thinking about hiring goals for the year, they are not going to concern themselves with the goals of the VP of Diversity and Inclusion. They are going to say \u2018hiring more engineers is my job, worrying about the diversity of who I hire is the job of the VP of Diversity and Inclusion.\u2019 When the VP of Diversity and Inclusion says \u2018your org is looking a little homogenous, do something about it,\u2019 the VP of Engineering won\u2019t prioritize that because the VP of Engineering doesn\u2019t report to the VP of Diversity and Inclusion, so knows there usually isn\u2019t shit the VP of Diversity and Inclusion can do if the Eng org doesn\u2019t see some improvement in diversity.\u201d*\n\nIndeed, this is sad, but true. When faced with a high-visibility conundrum like diversity hiring, a pragmatic and even reasonable reaction on any company\u2019s part is to make a few high-profile hires and throw money at the problem. Then, it looks like you\u2019re doing something, and spinning up a task force or a department or new set of titles is a lot easier than attempting to uproot the entire status quo.\n\n**As such, we end up with a newly minted, well-funded department pumping a ton of resources into feeding people who\u2019ve not yet learned about the interviewing being a game into a broken, nondeterministic machine of a process made further worse by the fact that said process favors confidence and persistence over bona fide ability\u2026 and where the link between success in navigating said process and subsequent on-the-job performance is tenuous at best.**\n\n## How to fix things\n\nIn the evolution of the technical interview, we saw a gradual reduction in the need for proxies as companies as the technology to write code together remotely emerged; with its advent, abstract, largely arbitrary puzzle questions could start to be phased out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the next step? **Technology has the power to free us from relying on proxies**, so that we can look at each individual as an indicative, unique bundle of performance-based data points. At interviewing.io, we make it possible to move away from proxies by looking at each interviewee as a collection of data points that tell a story, rather than one arbitrary glimpse of something they did once.\n\nBut that\u2019s not enough either. Interviews themselves need to continue to evolve. The process itself needs to be repeatable, predictive of aptitude at the actual job, and not a system to be gamed, where a huge benefit is incurred by knowing the rules. And the larger organizations whose processes act as a template for everyone else need to lead the charge. Only then can we really be welcoming to a truly diverse group of candidates.\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

It didn't.\n\nBy Samantha Jordan | Published: February 12, 2018; Last updated: September 30, 2023\n\ninterviewing.io is a platform where engineers practice technical interviewing anonymously. If things go well, they can unlock the ability to participate in real, still anonymous, interviews with top companies like Twitch, Lyft and more. Earlier this year, we launched an offering specifically for university students, with the intent of helping level the playing field right at the start of people\u2019s careers. The sad truth is that with the state of college recruiting today, if you don\u2019t attend one of very few top schools, your chances of interacting with companies on campus are slim. It\u2019s not fair, and it sucks, but university recruiting is still dominated by career fairs. Companies pragmatically choose to visit the same few schools every year, and despite the career fair being one of the most antiquated, biased forms of recruiting that there is, the format persists, likely due to the fact that there doesn\u2019t seem to be a better way to quickly connect with students at scale. **So, despite the increasingly loud conversation about diversity, campus recruiting marches on, and companies keep doing the same thing expecting different results.**\n\nIn a previous blog post, we explained [why companies should stop courting students from the same five schools](https://interviewing.io/blog/if-you-care-about-diversity-you-should-stop-hiring-from-the-same-five-schools). Regardless of your opinion on how important that idea is (for altruistic reasons, perhaps), you may have been left skeptical about the value and practicality of broadening the college recruiting effort, and you probably concede that it\u2019s rational to visit top schools, given limited resources \u2014 while society is often willing to agree that there are perfectly qualified students coming out of non-top colleges, they maintain that they\u2019re relatively rare. We\u2019re here to show you, with some nifty data from our university platform, that this not true.\n\nTo be fair, this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve looked at whether where you went to school matters. In a previous post, we found that [taking Udacity and Coursera programming classes mattered way more than where you went to school](https://interviewing.io/blog/lessons-from-3000-technical-interviews). And way back when, one of our founders figured out that where you went to school didn\u2019t matter at all but that [the number of typos and grammatical errors on your resume did](https://blog.alinelerner.com/lessons-from-a-years-worth-of-hiring-data/). So, what\u2019s different this time? The big, exciting thing is that these prior analyses were focused mostly on engineers who had been working for at least a few years already, making it possible to argue that a few years of work experience smoothes out any performance disparity that comes from having attended (or not attended a top school). In fact, the good people at Google found that while GPA didn\u2019t really matter after a few years of work, [it did matter for college students](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-google-hires-people-2013-6). So, we wanted to face this question head-on and look specifically at college juniors and seniors while they\u2019re still in school. **Even more pragmatically, we wanted to see if companies limiting their hiring efforts to just top schools means they\u2019re going to get a higher caliber of candidate.**\n\nBefore delving into the numbers, here\u2019s a quick rundown of how our university platform works and the data we collect.\n\n## The setup\n\nFor students who want to practice on interviewing.io, the first step is a brief (~15-minute) coding assessment on [Qualified](https://www.qualified.io/) to test basic programming competency. Students who pass this assessment, i.e. those who are ready to code while another human being breathes down their neck, get to start booking practice interviews.\n\nWhen an interviewer and an interviewee match on our platform, they meet in a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard and jump right into a technical question. Check out our [recordings](https://interviewing.io/mocks) page to see this process in action.\n\nInterview questions on the platform tend to fall into the category of what you\u2019d encounter at a phone screen for a back-end software engineering role, and interviewers typically come from top companies like Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Airbnb, and more.\n\nAfter every interview, interviewers rate interviewees on a few different dimensions, including technical ability. Technical ability gets rated on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 is \u201cpoor\u201d and 4 is \u201camazing!\u201d. On our platform, a score of 3 or above has generally meant that the person was good enough to move forward. You can see what our feedback form looks like below:\n\n![Screenshot of the Interviewing.io interview feedback form highlighting the question: How were their technical skills?](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F9fdaa_new_interviewer_feedback_circled_3de7112d80.webp%3Fupdated_at%3D2022-12-08T01%3A21%3A24.672Z&w=1200&q=75 \"How were their technical skills?\")\n\n**On our platform, we\u2019re fortunate to have thousands of students from all over the U.S., spanning over 200 universities. We thought this presented a unique opportunity to look at the relationship between school tier and interview performance for both juniors (interns) and seniors (new grads).** To study this relationship, we first split schools into the following four tiers, based on rankings from U.S. News & World Report:\n\n- **\u201cElite\u201d** schools (e.g. MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, UC-Berkeley)\n- **Top 15 schools** (not including top tier, e.g. University of Wisconsin, Cornell, Columbia)\n- **Top 50 schools** (not including top 15, e.g. Ohio State University, NYU, Arizona State University)\n- **The rest** (e.g. Michigan State, Vanderbilt University, Northeastern University, UC-Santa Barbara)\n\nThen, we ran some statistical significance testing on interview scores vs. school tier to see if school tier mattered, for both interns (college juniors) and new grads (college seniors), comprising a set of roughly 1000 students.\n\n## Does school have anything to do with interview performance?\n\nIn the graphs below, you can see technical score distributions for interviews with students in each of the four school tiers (see legend). As you recall from above, each interview is scored on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 is the worst and 4 is the best.\n\nFirst, the college juniors\u2026\n\nAnd then, the seniors\u2026\n\n**What\u2019s pretty startling is that the shape of these distributions, for both juniors and seniors, is remarkably similar. Indeed, statistical significance testing revealed no difference between students of any tier when it came to interview performance.[1](#user-content-fn-1) What this means is that top-tier students are achieving the same results as those in no-name schools.** So the question becomes: if the students are comparable in skill, why are companies spending egregious amounts of money attracting only a subset of them?\n\n## Okay, so what are companies missing?\n\nBesides missing out on great, cheaper-to-acquire future employees, companies are missing out on an opportunity to save time and money. Right now a ridiculous amount of money is being spent on university recruiting. We\u2019ve previously cited the [$18k price tag just for entry to the MIT career fair](https://interviewing.io/blog/if-you-care-about-diversity-you-should-stop-hiring-from-the-same-five-schools). In a [study done by Lauren Rivera through the Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2015/10/firms-are-wasting-millions-recruiting-on-only-a-few-campuses), she reveals that one firm budgeted nearly $1m just for social recruiting events on a single campus.\n\nThe higher price tag of these events also means it makes even less sense for smaller companies or startups to try and compete with high-profile, high-profit tech giants. Most of the top schools that are being heavily pursued already have enough recruiters vying for their students. Unwittingly, this pursuit seems to run contrary to most companies desires for high diversity and long-term sustainable growth.\n\nEven when companies do believe talent is evenly distributed across school tiers, there are still reasons for why companies might recruit at top schools. There are other factors that help elevate certain schools in a recruiter\u2019s mind. There are long-standing company-school relationships (for example, the number of alumni who work at the company currently). There are signaling effects too \u2014 companies get Silicon Valley bonus points by saying their eng team is comprised of a bunch of ex-Stanford, ex-MIT, ex- etc. etc. students.\n\n## A quick word about selection bias\n\nSince this post appeared on Hacker News, there\u2019s been some loud, legitimate discussion about how the pool of students on interviewing.io may not be representative of the population at large because we have a self-selected pool of students who decided to practice interviewing. Certainly, all the blog posts we publish are subject to this (very valid) line of criticism, and for this post in particular. As such, selection bias in our user pool might mean that 1) we\u2019re getting only the worst students from top schools (because, presumably, the best ones don\u2019t need the practice), or 2) we\u2019re getting only the best/most motivated students for non-top schools, or both. Any subset of these is entirely possible, but we have a few reasons why we believe what we\u2019ve published here might hold true regardless.\n\nFirst off, in our experience, regardless of their background or pedigree, everyone is scared of technical interviewing. Case in point\u2026 before we started working on interviewing.io, we didn\u2019t really have a product yet. So before investing a lot of time and heartache into this questionable undertaking, we wanted to test the waters to see if interview practice was something engineers really wanted, and more so, who these engineers that wanted practice were. So, we put up a pretty mediocre landing page on Hacker News\u2026 and got something like 7,000 signups the first day. Of these 7,000 signups, roughly 25% were senior (4+ years of experience) engineers from companies like Google and Facebook (this isn\u2019t to say that they\u2019re necessarily the best engineers out there\u2026 but just that the engineers the market seems to value the most still need our service).\n\nAnother data point comes from one of our founders. Every year, Aline does a guest lecture on job search preparedness for a technical communication course at MIT. This course is one way to fulfill the computer science major communication requirement, so enrollment tends to span the gamut of computer science students. Before every lecture, she sends out a survey asking students what their biggest pain points are in preparing for their job search. Every year, trepidation about technical interviewing is either at the top of the list of 2nd from the top.\n\nAnd though this doesn\u2019t directly address the issue of whether we\u2019re only getting the best of the worst or the worst of the best (I hope the above has convinced you there\u2019s more to it than that), here\u2019s the distribution of school tiers among our users, which I expect mirrors the kinds of distributions companies see in their student applicant pool:\n\n## So what can companies do?\n\nAs such, companies may never stop recruiting at top-tier schools entirely, but they ought to at least include schools outside of that very small circle in the search for future employees. The end result of the data is the same: for good engineers, school means a lot less than we think. The time and money that companies put in to compete for candidates within the same select few schools would be better spent creating opportunities that include everyone, as well as developing tools to vet students more fairly and efficiently.\n\nAs you saw above, we used a 15-minute coding assessment to cull our inbound student flow, and just a short challenge leveled the playing field between students from all walks of life. At the very least, we\u2019d recommend employers do the same thing in their process. But, of course, we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t suggest one other thing.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. Of course, this hinges on everyone completing a quick 15-minute coding challenge first, to ensure they\u2019re ready for synchronous technical interviews. We\u2019re excited about this because companies can replicate this step in their process as well! [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

But it\u2019s also a huge source of stress and endless questions for new candidates. Just searching \u201chow do I prepare for a technical interview\u201d turns up millions of Medium posts, coding bootcamp blogs, Quora discussions, and entire books.\n\nDespite all this conversation, people struggle to know how they\u2019re even doing in interviews. [In a previous post](https://interviewing.io/blog/own-interview-performance), we found that a surprisingly large number of interviewing.io\u2019s users consistently underestimate their performance, making them more likely to drop out of the process and ultimately harder to hire. Now, and with considerably more data (over 10k interviews led by real software engineers!), we wanted to go deeper: **what seems to make candidates worse at gauging their own performance?**\n\nWe know some general facts that make accuracy a challenge: people aren\u2019t always great at assessing or even remembering their performance on difficult cognitive tasks like writing code.[1](#user-content-fn-1) Technical interviews can be particularly hard to judge if candidates don\u2019t have much experience with questions with no single right answer. Since many companies don\u2019t share any kind of detailed post-interview feedback (beyond a yes/no) with candidates for liability reasons, many folks never get any sense of how they did, what they did well, or what could have been better.[2](#user-content-fn-2),[3](#user-content-fn-3) Indeed, pulling back the curtain on interviewing, *across the industry,* was one of the primary motivators for building interviewing.io!\n\nBut to our knowledge there\u2019s little data out there looking specifically at how people feel after real interviews on this scale, across different companies\u2013so we gathered it, giving us the ability to test interesting industry assumptions about engineers and coding confidence.\n\nOne big factor we were interested in was **impostor syndrome**. Impostor syndrome resonates with a lot of engineers[4](#user-content-fn-4), indicating that many wonder whether they truly match up to colleagues and discount even strong evidence of competence as a fluke. Impostor syndrome can make us wonder whether we can count on the positive performance feedback that we\u2019re getting, and how much our opportunities have come from our own effort, versus luck. Of particular interest to us was whether this would show up for women on our platform. There\u2019s a lot of research evidence that candidates from underrepresented backgrounds experience a greater lack of belonging that feeds impostor syndrome[5](#user-content-fn-5), and this could show up as inaccuracy about judging your own interview performance.\n\n## The setup\n\ninterviewing.io is a platform where people can practice technical interviewing anonymously, and if things go well, get jobs at top companies in the process. We started it because resumes suck and because we believe that anyone, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to prove their mettle.\n\nWhen an interviewer and an interviewee match on interviewing.io, they meet in a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard and jump right into a technical question (feel free to [watch this process in action on our interview recordings page](https://interviewing.io/mocks)). After each interview, people leave one another feedback, and each party can see what the other person said about them once they both submit their reviews.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of an interviewer feedback form:\n\n![Screenshot of the Interviewing.io interviewer feedback form highlight the question: How were their technical skills?](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F9fdaa_new_interviewer_feedback_circled_8e5be18c42.png&w=750&q=75 \"How were their technical skills?\")\n\nFeedback form for interviewers\n\nImmediately after the interview, candidates answered a question about how well they thought they\u2019d done on the same 1-4 scale:\n\n![Screenshot of the Interviewing.io interviewee feedback form highlight the question: How well do you think you did?](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F15c64_new_interviewee_feedback_circled_edb300c741.png&w=640&q=75 \"How well do you think you did?\")\n\nFeedback form for interviewees\n\nFor this post, we looked at over 10k technical interviews led by real software engineers from top companies. In each interview, a candidate was rated by an interviewer on their problem-solving ability, technical ability, and communication skills, as well as whether the interviewer would advance them to the next round. This gave us a measure of how different someone\u2019s self-rating was from the rating that the interviewer actually gave them, and in which direction. In other words, how skewed was their estimation from their true performance?\n\nGoing in, we had some hunches about what might matter:\n\n- **Gender.** Would women be harder on their coding performance than men?\n- **Having been an interviewer before.** It seems reasonable that having been on the other side will pull back the curtain on interviews.\n- **Being employed at a top company.** Similar to above.\n- **Being a top-performing interviewee** on interviewing.io \u2014 people who are better interviewees overall might have more confidence and awareness of when they\u2019ve gotten things right (or wrong!)\n- **Being in the Bay Area** or not. Since tech is still so geographically centered on the Bay Area, we considered that folks who live in a more engineering-saturated culture could have greater familiarity with professional norms around interviews.\n- **Within the interview itself, question quality and interviewer quality.** Presumably, a better interviewer is also a better communicator, whereas a confusing interviewer might throw off a candidates\u2019 entire assessment of their performance. We also looked at whether it was a practice interview, or for a specific company role.\n- For some candidates, we could also look at few measures of their **personal brand** within the industry, like their number of GitHub and Twitter followers. Maybe people with a strong online presence are more sure of themselves when they interview?\n\n## So what did we find?\n\n### Women are just as accurate as men at assessing their technical ability\n\nContrary to expectations around gender and confidence, we *didn\u2019t* find a reliable statistically significant gender difference in accuracy. At first, it looked like female candidates were more likely to underestimate their performance, but when we controlled for other variables, like experience and rated technical ability, it turned out **the key differentiator was experience.** More experienced engineers are more accurate about their interview performance, and men are more likely to be experienced engineers, but experienced female engineers are just as accurate about their technical ability.\n\nBased on previous research, we hypothesized that impostor syndrome and a greater lack of belonging could result in female candidates penalizing their interview performance, but we didn\u2019t find that pattern[6](#user-content-fn-6). However, our finding echoes [a research project from the Stanford Clayman Institute for Gender Research](https://gender.stanford.edu/sites/gender/files/climbing_the_technical_ladder.pdf), which looked at 1,795 mid-level tech workers from high tech companies. They found that women in tech aren\u2019t necessarily less accurate when assessing their own abilities, but do have significantly different ideas about what success requires (e.g., long working hours and risk-taking). In other words, **women in tech may not doubt their own abilities but might have different ideas about what\u2019s expected**. [And a survey from Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified)  asking over a thousand professionals about their job application decisions also made this point. Their results emphasized that gender gaps in evaluation scenarios could be more about **different expectations for how scenarios like interviews are judged.**\n\nThat said, we did find one interesting difference: women went through fewer practice interviews overall than men did. The difference was small but statistically significant, and harkens back to our earlier finding that women leave interviewing.io roughly 7 times as often as men do, after a bad interview.\n\nBut in that same earlier post, we also found that masking voices didn\u2019t impact interview outcomes. This whole cluster of findings affirms what we suspected and what the folks doing [in-depth studies of gender in tech](https://gender.stanford.edu/sites/gender/files/climbing_the_technical_ladder.pdf) have found: **it\u2019s complicated.** Women\u2019s lack of persistence in interviews can\u2019t be explained only by impostor syndrome about their *own* abilities, but it\u2019s still likely that they\u2019re interpreting negative feedback more severely and making different assumptions about interviews.\n\nHere\u2019s the distribution of accuracy distance for both female and male candidates on our platform (zero indicates a rating that matches the interviewer\u2019s score, while negative values indicate underestimated score, and positive values indicate an overestimated score). The two groups look pretty much identical:\n\n### What else didn\u2019t matter?\n\nAnother surprise: **having been an interviewer didn\u2019t help**. Even people who had been interviewers themselves don\u2019t seem to get an accuracy boost from that. **Personal brand was another non-finding**. **People with more GitHub followers weren\u2019t more accurate** than people with few to no GitHub followers. **Nor did interviewer rating matter** (i.e. how well an interviewer was reviewed by their candidates), although to be fair, interviewers are generally rated quite highly on the site.\n\n### So what was a statistically significant boost to accurate judgments of interview performance? Mostly, experience.\n\nExperienced engineers have a better sense for how well they did in interviews, compared with engineers earlier in their careers.[7](#user-content-fn-7) But it doesn\u2019t seem to *just* be that you\u2019re better at gauging your interview performance because you\u2019re better at writing code; although there is a small lift from this, with higher rated engineers being more accurate. But when you look at junior engineers, **even top-performing junior candidates struggled to accurately assess their performance**.[8](#user-content-fn-8)\n\nOur data mirrors a trend seen in [Stack Overflow\u2019s 2018 Developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#connection-and-competition). They asked respondents several questions about confidence and competition with other developers, and noted that more experienced engineers feel less competitive and more confident.[9](#user-content-fn-9) This isn\u2019t necessarily surprising: experience is correlated with skill level, after all, and highly skilled people are likely to be more confident. But our analysis let us control for performance and code skill within career groups, and we *still* found that experienced engineers were better at predicting their interview scores. There are probably multiple factors here: experienced engineers have been through more interviews, have led interviews themselves, and have a stronger sense of belonging, all of which may combat impostor syndrome.\n\n**Insider knowledge and context also seems to help:** Being in the Bay Area and being at a top company both made people more accurate. Like the experienced career group, engineers who seem more likely to have *contextual industry knowledge* are also more accurate. We found small but statistically significant lifts from factors like being located in the Bay Area and working at a top company. However, the lift from working at a top company seems to mostly measure a lift from overall technical ability: being at a top company is essentially a proxy measure for being a more experienced, higher quality engineer.\n\n**Finally, as you get better at interviewing and move into company interviews, you do get more accurate.** People were more accurate about their performance in company interviews compared to practice interviews, and their overall ranking on the interviewing.io site also predicted improved accuracy: interviewing.io also gives users an overall ranking, based on their performance over multiple interviews and weighted toward more recent measures. People who scored in the top 25% were more likely to be accurate about their interview performance.\n\nIn general, how are people at gauging their interview performance overall? [We\u2019ve looked at this before](https://interviewing.io/blog/own-interview-performance), with roughly a thousand interviews, and now, with ten thousand, the finding continues to hold up. Candidates were accurate about how they did in only 46% of interviews, and underestimated themselves in 35% of interviews (and the remaining 19%, of course, are the overestimators). Still, candidates are generally on the right track \u2014 it\u2019s not like people who score a 4 are always giving themselves a 1.[10](#user-content-fn-10) Self-ratings *are* statistically significantly predictive for actual interview scores (and positively correlated), but that relationship is noisy.\n\n## The implications\n\nAccurately judging your own interview performance is a skill in its own right and one that engineers need to learn from experience and context in the tech industry. But we\u2019ve also learned that **many of the assumptions we made about performance accuracy didn\u2019t hold up to scrutiny \u2014** female engineers had just as accurate a view of their own skills as male ones, and engineers who had led more interviews or were well known on GitHub weren\u2019t particularly better at gauging their performance.\n\nWhat does this mean for the industry as a whole? First off, impostor syndrome appears to be the bleary-eyed monster that attacks across gender ability, and how good you are, or where you are, or how famous you are isn\u2019t that important. Seniority does help mitigate some of the pain, but impostor syndrome affects everyone, regardless of who they are or where they\u2019re from. So, maybe it\u2019s time for a kinder, more empathetic interviewing culture. And a culture that\u2019s kinder to everyone, because though marginalized groups who haven\u2019t been socialized in technical interviewing are [hit the hardest by shortcomings in the interview process](https://interviewing.io/blog/you-cant-fix-diversity-in-tech-without-fixing-the-technical-interview), no one is immune to self-doubt.\n\nWe\u2019ve previously discussed what makes someone a good interviewer, and [empathy plays a disproportionately large role](https://interviewing.io/blog/best-technical-interviews-common). And we\u2019ve seen that [providing immediate post-interview feedback is really important for keeping candidates from dropping out](https://interviewing.io/blog/own-interview-performance). So, whether you\u2019re motivated by kindness and ideology or cold, hard pragmatism, a bit more kindness and understanding toward your candidates is in order.\n\n*[Cat Hicks](https://www.drcathicks.com/), the author of this guest post, is a researcher and data scientist with a focus on learning.

One important criticism is that it\u2019s highly impacted by people\u2019s motivation and emotional state at the time of asking. See: Sitzmann, T., Ely, K., Brown, K. G., & Bauer, K. N. (2010).

One complication for our dataset is the representation of experienced female engineers: we simply didn\u2019t have very many, which is true to the demographics of the tech industry, but also means that selection biases in the small group of experienced female engineers we do have are more likely to be present, and this isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all of exploring for group differences. We\u2019d like to continue looking at interviews with female participants to explore this fully. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-6)\n7. These effects and the previous non-findings were all explored in a linear mixed model. Significant results for the individual effects are all p < .05 [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-7)\n8.

Another wrinkle with the design behind this data is that there\u2019s a floor and a ceiling on the scale: people who always score a 4, for example, *can\u2019t* ever overrate themselves, because they\u2019re already at the top of the scale. We dealt with this a couple of ways: by excluding people at the floor and ceiling and re-running analyses on the middle subset, and by binning skew into either accurate or not and looking at that. The findings hold up across this. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-10)\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

We started it because [resumes suck](https://interviewing.io/blog/resumes-suck-heres-the-data) and because we believe that anyone, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to prove their mettle.\n\nIn February of 2016, we published a [post about how people\u2019s technical interview performance, from interview to interview, seemed quite volatile](https://interviewing.io/blog/technical-interview-performance-is-kind-of-arbitrary-heres-the-data/). At the time, we just had a few hundred interviews to draw on, so as you can imagine, we were quite eager to rerun the numbers with the advent of more data. **After drawing on over a thousand interviews, the numbers hold up. In other words, technical interview outcomes do really seem to be kind of arbitrary.**\n\n## The setup\n\nWhen an interviewer and an interviewee match on interviewing.io, they meet in a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard and jump right into a technical question. After each interview, people leave one another feedback, and each party can see what the other person said about them once they both submit their reviews.\n\nAfter every interview, interviewers rate interviewees on a few different dimensions, including technical ability. Technical ability gets rated on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 is \u201cpoor\u201d and 4 is \u201camazing!\u201d ([you can see the feedback form here](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9fdaa_new_interviewer_feedback_circled_2d4ba08149.png)). On our platform, a score of 3 or above has generally meant that the person was good enough to move forward.\n\nAt this point, you might say, that\u2019s nice and all, but what\u2019s the big deal? Lots of companies collect this kind of data in the context of their own pipelines. Here\u2019s the thing that makes our data special: **the same interviewee can do multiple interviews, each of which is with a different interviewer and/or different company, and this opens the door for some pretty interesting and somewhat controlled comparative analysis**.\n\n## Performance from interview to interview really is arbitrary\n\nIf you\u2019ve read our [first post](https://interviewing.io/blog/technical-interview-performance-is-kind-of-arbitrary-heres-the-data) on this subject, you\u2019ll recognize the visualization below. For the as yet uninitiated, every tiny human icon represents the mean technical score for an individual interviewee who has done 2 or more interviews on the platform. The y-axis is standard deviation of performance, so the higher up you go, the more volatile interview performance becomes. If you hover over each , you can drill down and see how that person did in each of their interviews. Anytime you see bolded text with a dotted underline, you can hover over it to see relevant data viz. Try it now to expand everyone\u2019s performance. You can also hover over the labels along the x-axis to drill into the performance of people whose means fall into those buckets.\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Clean_Shot_2022_12_22_at_11_55_47_2x_1ec095b1a8.png)\n\nAs you can see, roughly 20% of interviewees are consistent in their performance (down from 25% the last time we did this analysis), and the rest are all over the place. If you look at the graph above, despite the noise, you can probably make some guesses about which people you\u2019d want to interview. **However, keep in mind that each represents a *mean*. Let\u2019s pretend that, instead, you had to make a decision based on just one data point. That\u2019s where things get dicey**.[1](#user-content-fn-1) For instance:\n\n- Many people who scored at least one 4 also scored at least one 2.\n- And as you saw above, a good amount of people who scored at least one 4 also scored at least one 1.\n- If we look at high performers (mean of 3.3 or higher), we still see a fair amount of variation.\n- Things get really murky when we consider \u201caverage\u201d performers (mean between 2.6 and 3.3).\n\n## What do the most volatile interviewees have in common?\n\nIn the plot below, you can see interview performance over time for interviewees with the highest standard deviations on the platform (the cutoff we used was a standard dev of 1 or more, and this accounted for roughly 12% of our users). Note that the mix of dashed and dotted lines is purely visual \u2014 this way it\u2019s easier to follow each person\u2019s performance path.\n\n**So, what do the most highly volatile performers have in common? The answer appears to be, well, nothing.** About half were working at top companies while interviewing, and half weren\u2019t. Breakdown of top school was roughly 60/40. And years of experience didn\u2019t have much to do with it either \u2014 a plurality of interviewees having between 2 and 6 years of experience, with the rest all over the board (varying between 1 and 20 years).\n\n**So, all in all, the factors that go into performance volatility are likely a lot more nuanced than the traditional cues we often use to make value judgments about candidates.**\n\n## Why does volatility matter?\n\nI discussed the implications of these findings for technical hiring at length in the last post, but briefly, a noisy, non-deterministic interview process does no favors to either candidates or companies. Both end up expending a lot more effort to get a lot less signal than they ought, and in a climate where software engineers are at such a premium, noisy interviews only serve to exacerbate the problem.\n\nBut beyond micro and macro inefficiencies, I suspect there\u2019s something even more insidious and unfortunate going on here. Once you\u2019ve done a few traditional technical interviews, the volatility and lack of determinism in the process is something you figure out anecdotally and kind of accept. And if you have the benefit of having friends who\u2019ve also been through it, it only gets easier. What if you don\u2019t, however?\n\nIn a previous post, we talked about how [women quit interview practice 7 times more often](https://interviewing.io/blog/voice-modulation-gender-technical-interviews) than men after just one bad interview. It\u2019s not too much of a leap to say that this is probably happening to any number of groups who are underrepresented/underserved by the current system. In other words, though it\u2019s a broken process for everyone, the flaws within the system hit these groups the hardest\u2026 because they haven\u2019t had the chance to internalize just how much of technical interviewing is a game. More on this subject in our next post!\n\n## What can we do about it?\n\nSo, yes, the state of technical hiring isn\u2019t great right now, but here\u2019s what we can say. **If you\u2019re looking for a job, the best piece of advice we can give you is to really internalize that interviewing is a numbers game.** Between the kind of volatility we discussed in this post, [impostor syndrome](https://interviewing.io/blog/own-interview-performance), [poor evaluation techniques](https://interviewing.io/blog/resumes-suck-heres-the-data), and how hard it can be to get meaningful, realistic practice, it takes a lot of interviews to find a great job.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re hiring people, in the absence of a radical shift in how we vet technical ability, we\u2019ve learned that drawing on aggregate performance is much more meaningful than a making such an important decision based on one single, arbitrary interview. Not only can aggregative performance help correct for an uncharacteristically poor performance, but it can also weed out people who eventually do well in an interview by chance or those who, over time, simply up and memorize *Cracking the Coding Interview*. At interviewing.io, **even after just a handful of interviews, we have a much better picture of what someone is capable of and where they stack up than a single company would after a single interview, and aggregate data tells a much more compelling, repeatable story than one, arbitrary data point**.\n\n*Huge thanks to [Ian Johnson](https://twitter.com/enjalot), creator of [d3 Building Blocks](http://blockbuilder.org/), who made the graph entitled \"Standard Dev vs. Mean of Interviewee Performance\" (the one with the icons) as well as all the visualizations that go with it.*\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. At this point you might say that it\u2019s erroneous and naive to compare raw technical scores to one another for any number of reasons, not the least of which is that one interviewer\u2019s 4 is another interviewer\u2019s 2. For a comprehensive justification of using raw scores comparatively, please check out the [appendix](https://interviewing.io/blog/technical-interview-performance-is-kind-of-arbitrary-heres-the-data) to our previous post on this subject. Just to make sure the numbers hold up, I reran them, and this time, our R-squared is even higher than before (0.41 vs. 0.39 last time). [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

Aline is the CEO and co-founder of interviewing.io, and results like these are what inspired her to start this company.*\n\nI ran technical recruiting at [TrialPay](http://www.trialpay.com) for a year before going off to start my own agency. Because I used to be an engineer, one part of my job was conducting first-round technical interviews, and between January 2012 and January 2013, I interviewed roughly 300 people for our back-end/full-stack engineer position.\n\nTrialPay was awesome and gave me a lot of freedom, so I was able to use my intuition about whom to interview. As a result, candidates ranged from self-taught college dropouts or associate\u2019s degree holders to PhD holders, ACM winners, MIT/Harvard/Stanford/Caltech students, and Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and Google interns and employees with a lot of people in between.\n\n**While interviewing such a wide cross section of people, I realized that I had a golden opportunity to test some of the prevalent folk wisdom about hiring.** The results were pretty surprising, so I thought it would be cool to share them. Here\u2019s what I found:\n\n- typos and grammatical errors matter more than anything else\n- having attended a top computer science school doesn\u2019t matter\n- listing side projects on your resume isn\u2019t as advantageous as expected\n- GPA doesn\u2019t seem to matter\n\nAnd the least surprising thing that I was able to confirm was that:\n\n- having worked at a top company matters\n\nOf course, a data set of size 300 is a pittance, and I\u2019m a far cry from a data scientist. Most of the statistics here is done with the help of [Statwing](http://www.statwing.com) and with Wikipedia as a crutch. With the advent of more data and more rigorous analysis, perhaps these conclusions will be proven untrue. But, you gotta start somewhere.\n\n## Why any of this matters\n\nIn the status quo, most companies don\u2019t run exhaustive analyses of hiring data, and the ones that do keep it closely guarded and only share [vague generalities](http://www.businessinsider.com/big-data-in-the-workplace-2013-5) with the public. As a result, a certain mysticism persists in hiring, and great engineers who don\u2019t fit in \u201cthe mold\u201d end up getting cut before another engineer has the chance to see their work.\n\nWhy has a pedigree become such a big deal in an industry that\u2019s supposed to be a meritocracy? At the heart of the matter is scarcity of resources. When a company gets to be a certain size, hiring managers don\u2019t have the bandwidth to look over every resume and treat every applicant like a unique and beautiful snowflake. As a result, the people doing initial resume filtering are not engineers. Engineers are expensive and have better things to do than read resumes all day. Enter recruiters or HR people. As soon as you get someone who\u2019s never been an engineer making hiring decisions, you need to set up proxies for aptitude. Because these proxies need to be easily detectable, things like a CS degree from a top school become paramount.\n\n**Bemoaning that non-technical people are the first to filter resumes is silly because it\u2019s not going to change. What can change, however, is how they do the filtering.** We need to start thinking analytically about these things, and I hope that publishing this data is a step in the right direction.\n\n## Method\n\nTo sort facts from folk wisdom, I isolated some features that were universal among resumes and would be easy to spot by technical and non-technical people alike and then ran statistical significance tests on them. My goal was to determine which features were the strongest signals of success, which I defined as getting an offer. I ran this analysis on people whom we decided to interview rather than on every applicant; roughly out 9 out of 10 applicants were screened out before the first round. The motivation there was to gain some insight into what separates decent candidates from great ones, which is a much harder question than what separates poor candidates from great ones.\n\nCertainly there will be some sampling bias at play here, as I only looked at people who chose to apply to TrialPay specifically, but I\u2019m hoping that TrialPay\u2019s experience could be a stand-in for any number of startups that enjoy some renown in their specific fields but are not known globally. It also bears mentioning that this is a study into what resume attributes are significant when it comes to getting hired rather than when it comes to on-the-job performance.\n\nHere are the features I chose to focus on (in no particular order):\n\n- BS in Computer Science from a top school (as determined by U.S. News and World Report)\n- Number of grammatical errors, spelling errors, and syntactic inconsistencies\n- Frequency of buzzwords (programming languages, frameworks, OSes, software packages, etc.)\n- How easy it is to tell what someone did at each of their jobs\n- Highest degree earned\n- Resume length\n- Presence of personal projects\n- Work experience in a top company\n- Undergraduate GPA\n\n## TrialPay\u2019s hiring bar and interview process\n\nBefore I share the actual results, a quick word about context is in order. TrialPay\u2019s hiring standards are quite high. We ended up interviewing roughly 1 in 10 people that applied. Of those, after several rounds of interviewing (generally a phone screen followed by a live coding round followed by onsite), we extended offers to roughly 1 in 50, for an ultimate offer rate of 1 in 500. The interview process is pretty standard, though the company shies away from asking puzzle questions that depend on some amount of luck/clicking to get the correct answer. Instead, they prefer problems that gradually build on themselves and open-ended design and architecture questions. For a bit more about what TrialPay\u2019s interview process (used to) look like, check out [Interviewing at TrialPay 101](https://web.archive.org/web/20150201092525/http://enginerds.trialpay.com/2013/03/08/trialpay-engineering-interviews/).\n\n## The results\n\nNow, here\u2019s what I discovered. The bar height represents [effect size](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size). Every feature with a bar was statistically significant, and if you mouse over each bar, you can also see the [p-value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value). These results were quite surprising, and I will try to explain and provide more info about some of the more interesting stuff I found.\n\n![Chart showing the effect size of various resume features](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F47643_effect_size_of_resume_features_313437aa69.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Effect Size of Resume Features\")\n\n---\n\nThe most significant feature by far was the presence of typos, grammatical errors, or syntactic inconsistencies.\n\nErrors I counted included everything from classic transgressions like mixing up \u201cits\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s\u201d to typos and bad comma usage. In the figure below, I\u2019ve created a fictional resume snippet to highlight some of the more common errors.\n\n![Sample resume fragment highlighting common errors](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fissues_5ce006ca10.png&w=1920&q=75)\n\nThis particular result was especially encouraging because it\u2019s something that can be spotted by HR people as well as engineers. When I surveyed 30 hiring managers about which resume attributes they thought were most important, however, no one ranked number of errors highest. Presumably, hiring managers don\u2019t think that this attribute is that important for a couple of reasons: (1) resumes that are rife with mistakes get screened out before even getting to them and (2) people almost expect engineers to be a bit careless with stuff like spelling and grammar. With respect to the first point, keep in mind that the resumes in this analysis were only of people whom we decided to interview. With respect to the 2nd point, namely that engineers shouldn\u2019t be held to the same writing standards as people in more humanities-oriented fields, I give you my next chart. Below is a breakdown of how resumes that ultimately led to an offer stacked up against those that didn\u2019t. (Here, I\u2019m showing the absolute number of errors, but when I ran the numbers against number of errors adjusted for resume length, the results were virtually identical.)\n\nIf you want to play with these histograms, just click on the image, and an interactive version will pop up in a separate window.\n\n![Charts showing error frequencies among candidates with and without offers](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ferrors_histogram_f9a2291694.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Error frequencies among candidates\")\n\n**As you can see, the distributions look quite different between the group of people who got offers and those that didn\u2019t. Moreover, about 87% of people who got offers made 2 or fewer mistakes**.\n\nIn startup situations, not only are good written communication skills extremely important (a lot of heavy lifting and decision making happens over email), but I have anecdotally found that being able to write well tends to correlate very strongly with whether a candidate is good at more analytical tasks. Not submitting a resume rife with errors is a sign that the candidate has strong attention to detail which is an invaluable skill when it comes to coding, where there are often all manners of funky edge cases and where you\u2019re regularly being called upon to review others\u2019 code and help them find obscure errors that they can\u2019t seem to locate because they\u2019ve been staring at the same 10 lines of code for the last 2 hours.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that a resume isn\u2019t something you write on the spot. Rather, it\u2019s a document that you have every opportunity to improve. You should have at least 2 people proofread your resume before submitting it. When you do submit, you\u2019re essentially saying, \u201cThis is everything I have done. This is what I\u2019m proud of. This is the best I can do.\u201d So make sure that that is actually true, and don\u2019t look stupid by accident.\n\n## Top company\n\nNo surprises here. The only surprise is that this attribute wasn\u2019t more significant. Though I\u2019m generally not too excited by judging someone on pedigree, having been able to hold down a demanding job at a competitive employer shows that you can actually, you know, hold down a demanding job at a competitive employer.\n\nOf all the companies that our applicants had on their resumes, I classified the following as elite: Amazon, Apple, Evernote, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Oracle, any Y Combinator startup, Yelp, and Zynga.\n\n## Undergraduate GPA\n\nAfter I ran the numbers to try to figure out whether GPA mattered, the outcome was a bit surprising: GPA appeared to not matter at all. Take a look at the GPA distribution for candidates who got offers versus candidates that didn\u2019t (click to get a bigger, more interactive version).\n\n![Charts showing GPAs for candidates with and without offers](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fgpa_f345e799bf.png&w=1920&q=75 \"GPAs for candidates with/without offers\")\n\nAs a caveat, it\u2019s worth mentioning that roughly half of our applicants didn\u2019t list their GPAs on their resumes, so not only is the data set smaller, but there are probably some biases at play. I did some experiments with filling in the missing data and separating out new grads, and I will discuss those results in a future post.\n\n## Is it easy to tell what the candidate actually did?\n\nTake a look at this role description:\n\n![A fragment from a good role description](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Frole_desc_1521a16212.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Role description fragment #1\")\n\nNow take a look at this one:\n\n![A fragment from a bad role description](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbad_example_ac35863614.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Role description fragment #2\")\n\nIn which of these is it easier to tell what the candidate did? I would argue that the first snippet is infinitely more clear than the second. In the first, you get a very clear idea of what the product is, what the candidate\u2019s contribution was in the context of the product, and why that contribution matters. In the second, the candidate is using some standard industry lingo as a crutch \u2014 what he said could easily be applied to pretty much any software engineering position.\n\nJudging each resume along these lines certainly wasn\u2019t an exact science, and not every example was as cut-and-dry as the one above. Moreover, while I did my best to avoid confirmation bias while deciding whether I could tell what someone did, I\u2019m sure that the system wasn\u2019t perfect. All this said, however, I do find this result quite encouraging. **People who are passionate about and good at what they do tend to also be pretty good at cutting to the chase.** I remember the feeling of having to write my resume when I was looking for my first coding job, and I distinctly remember how easily words flowed when I was excited about a project versus when I knew inside that whatever I had been working on was some bullshit crap. In the latter case is when words like \u201csoftware development life cycle\u201d and a bunch of acronyms reared their ugly heads\u2026 a pitiful attempt to divert the reader from lack of substance by waving a bunch of impressive sounding terms in his face.\n\nThis impression is further confirmed by a word cloud generated from candidate resumes that received an offer versus those that didn\u2019t. For these clouds, I took words that appeared very frequently in one data set relative to how often they appeared in the other one.\n\n![Word cloud showing frequent words in successful resumes](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fcloud_1_00190b3201.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Frequent words in successful resumes\")\n\nOffer\n\n![Word cloud showing frequent words in unsuccessful resumes](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fcloud_2_15eace8bc4.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Frequent words in unsuccessful resumes\")\n\nNo offer\n\nAs you can see, \u201cgood\u201d resumes focused much more on action words/doing stuff (\u201cmanage\u201d, \u201cship\u201d, \u201cteam\u201d, \u201ccreate\u201d, and so on) versus \u201cbad\u201d resumes which, in turn, focused much more on details/technologies used/techniques.\n\n## Highest degree earned\n\n![A quote](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fquote_3_1a25aba753.png&w=1080&q=75 \"A quote\")\n\nThough highest degree earned didn\u2019t appear to be significant in this particular data set, there was a definite trend that caught my attention. Take a look at the graph of offers extended as a function of degree.\n\n![Chart showing offer likelihood as a function of highest degree earned by candidates](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Foffer_4_e24fb96866.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Offer Likelihood as a Function of Highest Degree Earned\")\n\nAs you can see, the higher the degree, the lower the offer rate. I\u2019m confident that with the advent of more data (especially more people without degrees and with master\u2019s degrees), this relationship will become more clear. **I believe that self-motivated college dropouts are some of the best candidates around because going out of your way to learn new things on your own time, in a non-deterministic way, while juggling the rest of your life is, in some ways, much more impressive than just doing homework for 4 years.** I\u2019ve already ranted quite a bit about [how worthless I find most MS degrees to be](http://blog.alinelerner.com/how-different-is-a-b-s-in-computer-science-from-a-m-s-in-computer-science-when-it-comes-to-recruiting/), so I won\u2019t belabor the point here.[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n\n## BS in Computer Science from a top school\n\n*But wait*, you say, *even if highest degree earned doesn\u2019t matter, not all BS degrees are created equal! And, having a BS in Computer Science from a top school must be important because it\u2019s in every fucking job ad I\u2019ve ever seen!*\n\nAnd to you I say, *Tough shit, buddy.* Then I feel a bit uncomfortable using such strong language, in light of the fact that n ~= 300. **However, roughly half of the candidates** (122, to be exact) **in the data set were sporting some fancy pieces of paper. And yet, our hire rate was not too different among people who had said fancy pieces of paper and those that didn\u2019t. In fact, in 2012, half of the offers we made at TrialPay were to people without a BS in CS from a top school.** This doesn\u2019t mean that every dropout or student from a 3rd rate school is an unsung genius \u2014 there were plenty that I cut before interviewing because they hadn\u2019t done anything to offset their lack of pedigree. However, I do hope that this finding gives you a bit of pause before taking the importance of a degree in CS from a top school at face value.\n\n![Product placement: Pedigree brand](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fpedigree_5_b98917bcd8.png&w=1080&q=75 \"Pedigree brand\")\n\nIn a nutshell, when you see someone who doesn\u2019t have a pedigree but looks really smart (has no errors/typos, very clearly explains what they worked on, shows passion, and so forth), do yourself a favor and interview them.\n\n## Personal projects\n\nOf late, it\u2019s become accepted that one should have some kind of side projects in addition to whatever it is you\u2019re doing at work, and this advice becomes especially important for people who don\u2019t have a nice pedigree on paper. Sounds reasonable, right? Here\u2019s what ends up happening. To game the system, applicants start linking to virtually empty GitHub accounts that are full of forked repos where they, at best, fixed some silly whitespace issue. In other words, it\u2019s like 10,000 forks when all you need is a glimmer of original thought.\n\n![A pile of forks](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffork_6_a18c62785b.png&w=1200&q=75 \"Many forks\")\n\nYay forks.\n\nOutside of that, there\u2019s the fact that not all side projects are created equal. I can find some silly tutorial for some flashy UI thing, copy the code from it verbatim, swap in something that makes it a bit personal, and then call that a side project on my resume. Or I can create a new, actually useful JavaScript framework. Or I can spend a year bootstrapping a startup in my off hours and get it up to tens of thousands of users. Or I can arbitrarily call myself CTO of something I spaghetti-coded in a weekend with a friend.\n\nTelling the difference between these kinds of projects is somewhat time-consuming for someone with a technical background and almost impossible for someone who\u2019s never coded before. **Therefore, while awesome side projects are a HUGE indicator of competence, if the people reading resumes can\u2019t (either because of lack of domain-specific knowledge or because of time considerations) tell the difference between awesome and underwhelming, the signal gets lost in the noise.**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhen I started this project, it was my hope that I\u2019d be able to debunk some myths about hiring or at least start a conversation that would make people think twice before taking folk wisdom as gospel. I also hoped that I\u2019d be able to help non-technical HR people get better at filtering resumes so that fewer smart people would fall through the cracks. Some of my findings were quite encouraging in this regard because things like typos/grammatical errors, clarity of explanation, and whether someone worked at an elite company are all attributes that a non-technical person can parse. I was also especially encouraged by undergraduate pedigree not necessarily being a signal of success. At the end of the day, spotting top talent is extremely hard, and much more work is needed. I\u2019m optimistic, however. As more data becomes available and more companies embrace the spirit of transparency, proxies for aptitude that don\u2019t stand up under scrutiny will be eliminated, better criteria will take their place, and smart, driven people will have more opportunities to do awesome things with their careers than ever before.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nA huge thank you to:\n\n- [TrialPay](http://www.trialpay.com), for letting me play with their data and for supporting my ideas, no matter how silly they sounded.\n- [Statwing](http://www.statwing.com), for making statistical analysis civilized and for saving me from the horrors of R (or worse, Excel).\n- Everyone who suggested features, helped annotate resumes, or proofread this monstrosity.\n\nLastly, see [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6326477 \"Hacker News\") for some good discussion.\n\nLooking for a job yourself?

An exploration into interviewing.io\u2019s pseudonym generator\n\nBy Atomic Artichoke | Published: March 6, 2019; Last updated: May 1, 2023\n\nHello everyone, my name is Atomic Artichoke, and I\u2019m the newest employee of the interviewing.io team, having joined a couple months ago as a Data Scientist.\n\nAtomic Artichoke isn\u2019t my real name, of course. That\u2019s the pseudonym the interviewing.io platform gave me, right before I took my final interview with the company. If you\u2019ve never used interviewing.io before (and hey, if you haven\u2019t already, [why not sign up now?](https://interviewing.io/signup)), it\u2019s a platform where you can practice technical interviewing anonymously with experienced engineers (and do real job interviews anonymously too).\n\n![Screenshot showing how an Interviewing.io user can pick their anonymous pseudonym](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fpseudonym_handle_3d625b5bb7.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Choosing a pseudonym\")\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to interview, you and your partner meet in a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard (check out [recordings of real interviews](https://interviewing.io/mocks) to see this process in action). During interviews, instead of your name, your partner will see your pseudonym, like so:\n\n![Screenshot showing how a user's anonymous pseudonym appears during a practice interview](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fpseudonym_code_2ee6deedd1.png&w=1080&q=75 \"Pseudonyms are always used unless an interviewer and interviewee have chosen to de-mask and reveal their names to each other\")\n\nIn my opinion, \u201cAtomic Artichoke\u201d is a pretty cool name. It sounds like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles villain, and alliterative phrases are always cool. However, I had some reservations about that handle, because I feel like the pseudonym represented me in ways with which I didn\u2019t identify. I don\u2019t know how to eat or cook an artichoke, I never really understood atoms much, and I possess no mutant superpowers.\n\nBut I wondered, how did the interviewer perceive me? Did this person think \u201cAtomic Artichoke\u201d was a cool name? If so, did that name influence his or her perception of me in any way? More importantly, **did my pseudonym have any influence in me getting hired?** If I had a different, less cool name, would I have gotten this job?\n\nI know, it\u2019s a silly question. I\u2019d like to think I was hired because of my skills, but who really knows? I was curious, so I ~~wasted~~ invested a few days to investigate.\n\n## What we already know about names in the hiring process\n\nYou might be asking, \u201cWhy does interviewing.io have pseudonyms, anyway?\u201d Anonymity. We want candidates to be assessed on their actual skills, not on proxies of skill like the colleges they\u2019ve attended, the notoriety of their social circles, or prior companies they\u2019ve worked at. If a hiring manager knows a person\u2019s name and knows how to use the Internet, it\u2019s easy to find this information.\n\nI\u2019m not the first to wonder about names and hiring. Plenty of academic literature exists exploring the impact of name choice on various life outcomes. I\u2019ll briefly touch on a handful of those perspectives.\n\n- A 1948 paper concluded people with unique names tended to have [lower academic performance than those with more common names](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224545.1948.9918930?journalCode=vsoc20).\n- A 2003 study observing the relationship between \u201cblack\u201d names and life outcomes concluded that after for controlling for other factors, [name choice did not affect life outcomes](https://www2.nber.org/papers/w9938.pdf?new_window=1).\n- Finally, a 2004 paper specifically focused on the jobs market suggested that resumes containing [\u201cblack\u201d names received fewer callbacks than those with \u201cwhite\u201d names](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828042002561), even after controlling for resume quality.\n\nAs you can see, academic opinions differ. However, in the case that name-based bias actually exists, maybe we can implement a cheap-enough solution to eliminate the bias completely. Randomly-generated pseudonyms fits that bill nicely.\n\nBut as I wondered before, maybe the pseudonym name generator creates a different kind of bias, leaving us in a similarly biased place that using real people\u2019s names leaves us. I first needed to understand how pseudonyms get generated, so I dug into some code.\n\n## Exploring code\n\nAfter dusting off what little Javascript knowledge I acquired 6 years ago, I found the 13 lines of code that generates pseudonyms. Mechanics-wise it\u2019s simple: there are two lists, one containing adjectives and one containing nouns. The pseudonym generator randomly pulls one adjective and one noun from each list, and mashes them together in that order, with a space in between. The generator outputs some sweet sounding pseudonyms like:\n\n- Serpentine Gyroscope\n- Moldy Parallelogram\n- Frumious Slide Rule\n- Supersonic Llama\n\nBut they can also come up with less memorable, more commonplace, and more boring phrases like:\n\n- Ice Snow\n- Warm Wind\n- Red Egg[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n- Infinite Avalanche\n\nAfter running through a few example pseudonyms, anecdotally I felt the first list was more attractive to me than the second. It sparked more joy in me, one could say. I just couldn\u2019t articulate why.\n\nThat\u2019s when I noticed that certain themes kept recurring. For example, there were multiple Alice in Wonderland references, a bunch of animals, and many types of foods listed. At first glance the chosen words seemed odd. But after getting to know my co-workers better, the list of words began to make a lot more sense.\n\nThe co-worker sitting across from me is a huge Alice in Wonderland fan. Our founders seem to love animals, since they bring their dogs to work most days. Finally, food and restaurant discussions fuel most lunchtime arguments. Just in my first month, I had heard more discussion about chicken mole and Olive Garden than I ever had in my life.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true the pseudonym generator chooses words randomly, the choice of which words get onto the list isn\u2019t necessarily random. If anything, the choice of words reflects the interests of the people who built the application. Might it be possible that the first list appealed to me because they reference math concepts, and I happen to like math-y things?\n\n## The hypothesis\n\nThis insight helped me craft my hypothesis more concretely: all else equal, do some candidates receive better ratings on interviews, **because interviewers happen to associate positively with users whose pseudonyms reference the interviewers\u2019 personal interests?**\n\nThis hypothesis rests upon the assumption that people are drawn to stuff that\u2019s similar to themselves. This seems intuitive: when individuals share common interests or backgrounds with others, chances are they\u2019ll like each other. Therefore, is it possible that interviewers like certain candidates more because they find commonality with them, even though we manufactured that commonality? And did that likability translate to better interview ratings?\n\nTo test this, I categorized users into one of the following 6 categories based on the noun part of their pseudonym, which will be called Noun Category going forward.\n\n- Animal\n- Fantasy\n- Food\n- History\n- Object\n- Science\n\nThese broad categories aimed to differentiate among interest areas that might appeal differently to different interviewers. Among these 6 groups, I wanted to observe differences in interview performance. And knowing the pseudonym generator assigns names randomly, we would not expect to find a difference.\n\nTo proxy for interview performance, I used the \u201cWould You Hire\u201d response from the interviewer on the interviewee, which is the first item on the interviewer\u2019s post-interview questionnaire.\n\n![Screenshot of the interview feedback form for an anonymous company round](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffake_names_bias_f8cd1ac082.png&w=1080&q=75 \"The interview feedback form for anonymous company rounds asks if the user wants to share their info\")\n\nThese two pieces of data led to a clear, testable null hypothesis: **there should exist no relationship between Noun Category and the Would You Hire response.** If we reject this null hypothesis, we would have evidence suggesting our pseudonyms can impact hiring decisions.\n\n## Data analysis and interpretation\n\nI pulled data on a sample of a few thousand interviewing.io candidates\u2019 first interview on our platform, and performed a Chi-Squared test against the observed frequencies of the 6 \u201cNoun Categories\u201d and 2 \u201cWould You Hire\u201d interviewer responses. Each cell of the 6 x 2 matrix contained at least 40 observations.\n\nBelow are the mean percentage of candidates who received a Yes from their interviewer, broken out by Noun Category. While most of the categories seemed to clump around a similar pass rate, the History group seemed to under-perform while the Fantasy group over-performed.\n\n![Chart showing Would You Hire Pass % vs Noun Category](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fd1730_would_you_hire_pass_vs_noun_category3_c020791d7b.webp&w=1200&q=75 \"Would You Hire Pass % vs Noun Category\")\n\nThe Chi-Square test rejected the null hypothesis at a 5% significance level.\n\nThese results suggest **a relationship might exists between Noun Category and an interviewer\u2019s Would You Hire response**. Which again, should *not* occur because a candidate\u2019s Noun Category was randomly assigned![2](#user-content-fn-2)\n\n## What next?\n\nWhile this analysis doesn\u2019t predict outcomes for specific individuals, the result suggests it isn\u2019t totally crazy to believe I may gotten lucky on my interview. Maybe I don\u2019t suffer from imposter syndrome, maybe I am an imposter. How depressing.\n\nSo what now? Fortunately (or unfortunately) for my new company, if we want to eliminate this bias, I can suggest potential next steps.\n\nOne solution might be to pander to an interviewer\u2019s interests. We could randomly generate a new pseudonym for candidates every time they meet a different interviewer, ensuring that pseudonym creates positive associations with the interviewer. Similarly, we could generate more pseudonyms referencing Lord of the Rings and Warcraft, if we know our interviewer pool tends to be fantasy-inclined.\n\nAn alternative solution might be to give candidates pseudonyms with no meaning at all. For example, we could generate random strings, similar to what password managers generate for you. This would eliminate any real world associations, but we\u2019d lose some whimsy and human readability that the current pseudonyms provide.\n\nYet another alternative solution could be to do more analysis before acting. The analysis didn\u2019t quantify the magnitude of the bias, so we could construct a new sample to test a more specific hypothesis about bias size. It\u2019s possible the practical impact of the bias isn\u2019t huge, and we should focus our energy elsewhere.\n\n## Zooming out\n\nOn the face of it, this pseudonym bias seems trivial, and in the universe of all biases that could exist, that\u2019s probably true. However, it makes me wonder how many other hidden biases might exist elsewhere in life.\n\nI think that\u2019s why I was hired. I\u2019m obsessed with bias. Though I\u2019ll be doing normal business-y Data Scientist stuff, my more interesting responsibilities will be poking at all aspects of the hiring market and examining the myriad of factors, mechanisms, and individuals that make the hiring market function, and perhaps not function effectively for some people.\n\nGoing a step further than identifying hiring biases, I\u2019d like to shift discussions toward action. It\u2019s great that the tech industry talks about diversity more, but I think we can facilitate more discussions around which concrete actions are being taken, and whether those actions actually achieve our goals, whatever those goals may be.\n\nI think it all starts with being introspective about ourselves, and investigating whether something as innocuous as a randomly generated phrase could ever matter.\n\nAtomic Artichoke\n(Ken Pascual)\n\n![Atomic Artichoke's personalized Interviewing.io sticker](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F28d03_image_from_ios_3_e1235e7732.webp%3Fupdated_at%3D2022-12-08T13%3A55%3A14.749Z&w=640&q=75 \"Atomic Aritichoke\")\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1.

It\u2019s very simple advice, so the bulk of this post will be spent trying to convince you that it\u2019s fine to postpone. And then of course I\u2019ll tell you what to say.\n\nDo any of these situations sound familiar?\n\n- A recruiter from a FAANG (or other top-tier) company contacts you out of the blue and invites you to interview. You do the recruiter call, and it goes well. The recruiter reaches out to schedule your technical phone screen. You haven\u2019t practiced enough, and you know it, but you are scared to tell the recruiter that you want to postpone the interview by a few months (months?!) because the position may no longer be there. So, you plow ahead, do the phone screen, fail it, and then you\u2019re frozen out for a year.\n- You were able to postpone your technical phone screen and take the time to study up on data structures & algorithms problems. You do well in the interview. But then your recruiter schedules your onsite the following week. Because you were so focused on DS&A prep, you haven\u2019t had much time to study up on system design. You fumble the system design interview during the onsite, and you either get rejected or get down-leveled.\n\nBoth of these situations are extremely common, but they\u2019re both preventable. You can just ask to postpone. There are a few edge cases where that\u2019s not a good idea, but in most situations, it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\n## When postponing is OK, and when you *shouldn\u2019t* take our advice\n\nIf you\u2019re applying to a large company with a centralized process (in other words, a process where you interview first and get matched with a team later), postponing is almost always OK. These companies are perpetually hiring, and their open roles are evergreen.[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n\nEven if you\u2019re applying to a large company with a decentralized process (where you interview for a specific team), we recommend postponing unless you\u2019re extremely excited about the team you\u2019re talking to. In that scenario, it\u2019s possible that if you postpone, the slot will be filled. But if it\u2019s not a perfect fit and you\u2019d be OK with another team, we recommend postponing \u2014 in the worst case, you\u2019ll simply get slotted into a different team.\n\nThe only time when postponing isn\u2019t a good idea is when you\u2019re applying to a very small company that has just one open headcount. In that scenario, it is possible that postponing will cost you the opportunity because they\u2019ll choose another candidate. However, you can ask how likely that is to happen, up front.\n\nWith that edge case out of the way, here\u2019s a little-known fact about how timing works at large companies: Recruiters don\u2019t really care when you interview. Though they\u2019d prefer that you interview sooner rather than later so they can hit their numbers, at the end of the day, they\u2019d rather be responsible for successful candidates than unsuccessful ones.\n\nEvery recruiter, in every job search, will tell you that time is of the essence because of all the other candidates in the pipeline. Most of the time, that is irrelevant and just something they say to create an artificial sense of urgency. There are always other candidates in the pipeline because the roles are evergreen. But they have nothing to do with your prospects.\n\n## Exactly what to say to postpone your interviews\n\nYou can use this text verbatim when postponing your interviews, and, with some small edits, you can even use it several times (e.g., before the phone screen and then again before the onsite).\n\n> *I\u2019m really excited about interviewing at [company name]. Unfortunately, if I\u2019m honest, I haven\u2019t had a chance to practice as much as I\u2019d like. I know how hard and competitive these interviews are, and I want to put my best foot forward. I think I\u2019ll realistically need a couple of months to prepare. How about we schedule my interview for [date]?*\n\nOne important thing to remember is to be conservative about how long it will take. You\u2019ve probably heard the adage about how, when you have to estimate the time an engineering task will take, you should think of a number and double it. Here, you may even want to triple it.\n\nI\u2019ve seen many candidates ask for 2 weeks because that feels like a reasonable thing to ask for, only to have it blow up in their face when they realize they need to ask for another extension (which is still worth doing but harder because the company may think you\u2019re taking them for a ride). If you need two months, ask for two months.\n\n## Postponing can also be a good way to control the timing of your job search\n\nThis section is extra credit, but once you get comfortable with postponing your interviews when you\u2019re not prepared, you can use the same skills to batch your interviews and ultimately control the timing of your job search.\n\nWhat does it mean to control the timing of your job search? Ideally, you want all of your offers to come in at the same time, both because it maximizes optionality (one company that arbitrarily offers first doesn\u2019t rush you into making a decision) and maximizes leverage (you can negotiate from a position of power).\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into this process, take a look at a book I recently co-wrote, *[Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/dp/195570600X)*. It includes a full chapter about how to manage your job search, which covers everything from determining the order in which to approach companies to how to speed them up and slow them down once you\u2019re in process. There\u2019s a lot more detail than I can touch in this post, and much of it depends on your specific circumstances, but you can probably get 50% of the way there just by postponing your interviews in batches.\n\nThe big insight here is that, except for the edge cases we discussed above, a recruiting process can be paused at any point.\n\nIn other words, you can do a bunch of outreach to companies, then do a bunch of enthusiastic recruiter calls, and THEN pause all the processes until you\u2019re prepared to do technical phone screens.\n\nThen, you batch the phone screens.\n\nFinally, if needed, you pause again to give yourself time to prepare for onsites. Onsite interviews require a different skill set than technical phone screens. The technical phone screen isn\u2019t about depth or fit \u2014 it\u2019s just a way to cut people who aren\u2019t likely to pass the onsite.\n\nThe onsite, on the other hand, isn\u2019t just meant to cut poor performers. It\u2019s at once a deeper dive into your technical ability and a way to gauge fit. If you\u2019ll be interviewing with your future team (typical at companies with a decentralized process), it\u2019s also meant to assess your ability to work together, collaborate on hard things, complement the team's existing skillset, and so on. It usually has some coding (to verify that your technical phone screen wasn\u2019t a fluke), but the focus is usually on system design and behavioral interviews[2](#user-content-fn-2), which are also the interviews commonly used for leveling decisions.\n\nSo, onsite prep is much more about system design and getting your stories right for your behavioral interviews. Some people can pull off prepping for both coding and sys design/behavioral at the same time. For many, depending on their existing familiarity with the material, it\u2019s a tall order. So, it\u2019s wise to take the time you need and prepare.\n\nThen, once you\u2019re ready, you batch the onsites.\n\nWhen your offers come in, you should ask for extensions as needed, speed companies up, and start [negotiating](https://interviewing.io/blog/category/salary-negotiation) (which we\u2019ve written about in the past and which, of course, is covered at great depth in the book).\n\nFootnotes:\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. Yes, it\u2019s true that in 2022, we saw several FAANGs and many other companies freeze hiring, and if you had postponed your interviews, you\u2019d have been left out in the cold. Despite how devastating these freezes were to affected candidates (and to the tech economy as whole), they are extremely rare, and in our humble opinion, not worth optimizing for or worrying about. You are very unlikely to have to deal with an impending freeze. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n2. Some companies will also have technical deep dives, project presentations, assessments of niche skills, and so on. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-2)\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

Lack of feedback, or feedback that doesn\u2019t come right away, isn\u2019t just frustrating to candidates. It\u2019s bad for business. We did a whole study on this. It turns out that candidates chronically underrate and overrate their technical interview performance, like so: Where this finding starts to get actionable is that there\u2019s a statistically significant relationship between whether people think they did well in an interview and whether they\u2019d want to work with you.

One of the things that really gets my goat is when companies build employer brand by over-indexing on banalities (\u201clook we have a ping pong table!\u201d, \u201clook we\u2019re a startup so you\u2019ll have a huge impact\u201d, etc.) instead of focusing on the narratives that make them special. Hiring engineers is really hard.

Indeed, these are THE two metrics that any self-respecting recruiting team will track. Time to hire is important because it lets you plan \u2014 if a given role has historically taken 3 months to fill, you\u2019re going to act differently when you need to fill it again than if it takes 2 weeks. And, traditionally, cost per hire has been a planning tool as well \u2014 if you\u2019re setting recruiting budgets for next year and have a headcount in mind, seeing what recruiting spent last year is \u2026\n\n[Read more >](https://interviewing.io/blog/you-probably-dont-factor-in-engineering-time-when-calculating-cost-per-hire-heres-why-you-really-should)\n\n[Can fake names create bias?

He works as a tech consultant and has a decade of experience helping engineers land their dream jobs. He\u2019s a top-rated mentor (interviewing.io, Karat, Pathrise, Skilled.inc) and the author of viral technical content on system design and technical interview strategies featured on HackerNews, Business Insider, and Wired. He also sometimes writes technical content for interviewing.io (like this piece) and was one of the authors of interviewing.io\u2019s [A Senior Engineer's Guide to the System Design Interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview).\n\nYou can find him online at [mikemroczka.com](https://www.mikemroczka.com/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-mroczka/), and [X](https://x.com/mike_mroczka).\n\nHave you ever wondered if you should spend more time on LeetCode, participate in those contests, or focus on solving harder problems? A [popular Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1eg8060/you_probably_need_700_questions_to_actually_crack/) suggests you need 700+ questions and a LeetCode rating between 1800-2000 to pass FAANG interviews. Is this really what the data supports? To answer these questions and more, we looked at our users' LeetCode ranks and ratings and tied them back to interview performance on our platform and whether those users worked at FAANG.\n\nIn this post, we\u2019ll share what we\u2019ve learned.\n\n## The experiment\n\ninterviewing.io is an interview practice platform and recruiting marketplace for engineers. Engineers use us for mock interviews. Companies use us to hire top performers. Hundreds of thousands of engineers have used our platform to prepare for interviews, and we have performance data for over 100k technical interviews (split between real interviews and mocks).\n\nWe surveyed almost 700 of our users and asked them to share their LeetCode and LinkedIn profiles. From those profiles, we pulled our users\u2019 employment history, as well as their LeetCode data: number of problems worked, ratings, and, if they had it, contest performance. Finally, we cross-referenced all this data with their performance in mock and real interviews on interviewing.io.\n\nThis data set allowed us to start asking interesting questions. How much LeetCoding is useful? What kinds of problems are most useful to practice? How does LeetCode performance relate to performance in interviews with real people? Do LeetCode contest scores predict interview performance, and is a competitive coder likelier to work at a big tech company? Are hard questions worth solving or should we just stick with mediums? Let's find out!\n\n## Results\n\nThe matrix below summarizes our findings. In addition to all LeetCode fields listed below, we also looked into global ratings and contest ratings. It was harder to find a large enough sample size to see any effect of those who did contests. Since the results were not large enough to be informative we have excluded them from the rest of this piece. All findings listed below are statistically significant, with lighter squares indicating stronger correlations.\n\nFor each profile, we looked at the following attributes:\n\n- **Total questions**: the total number of questions solved on LeetCode\n- **Hard questions**: the number of \"hard\" questions solved on LeetCode\n- **Medium questions**: the number of \"medium\" questions solved on LeetCode\n- **Easy questions**: the number of \"easy\" questions solved on LeetCode\n- **Worked at FAANG**: whether or not the user has ever worked at a FAANG company\n- **interviewing.io percentile**: how an interviewing.io user stacks up against other users of the platform, after having completed at least one interview\n\n![How much Leetcode activity correlates with interview performance and FAANG employment](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fleetcode_activity_relationship_to_interview_performance_and_faang_empoyment_b84cc797d6.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nHow LeetCode attributes relate to having worked at FAANG and performance in mock and real interviews on interviewing.io. Correlations range from 1 (directly positively correlated) to -1 (directly negatively correlated). 0 means there\u2019s no relationship.\n\nThis matrix summarizes the correlations between LeetCode attributes (y axis) with 1) whether people worked at a FAANG and 2) how well they performed in interviews on interviewing.io (x axis). The higher the number (and the darker the color), the stronger the relationship.\n\nFor instance, the number of questions a user solved correlates with working at a FAANG company and a user\u2019s percentile ranking on interviewing.io. We see that it is a stronger predictor of interview performance than it is for working at a FAANG company (0.27 and 0.17, respectively).\n\nLet's dig into the most exciting findings!\n\n### The total number of questions you have completed matters!\n\n**Unsurprisingly, the total number of questions a user has completed correlates with having FAANG on their resume and doing well in technical interviews.** Those who work at FAANG companies appear to have completed more questions than those who do not.\n\n![FAANG engineers question volume compared to nonfaang engineers](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffaang_engineers_question_volume_compared_to_nonfaang_engineers_301c4b7405.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nDon't fret, though, as this doesn't mean you're doomed to be behind people who have started sooner and have amassed thousands of questions. The vast majority of our top users stop LeetCoding after they've hit about 500 questions. Only a fraction of top users have done more than ~500 questions, and only about 10 did more than a thousand questions. **As you might expect, there are seriously diminishing returns associated with doing more than 500 questions. Those who continued past the 500 questions performed only marginally better than those who had stopped near 500.**\n\n*In the zero-sum interviewing game, those who complete the most LeetCode questions generally get the highest interview scores and work at the most desirable tech companies, but completing ~500 questions will put you among the top talent in the current market.*\n\n### The difficulty level you attempt matters, too!\n\nIt is common wisdom on the LeetCode discussion board and subreddits to \"do medium questions, not hard questions,\" with the argument that companies don't ask LeetCode hards. Does this advice stand up to scrutiny? **Mostly no.**\n\nThe data shows a clear bias towards those who solved more challenging problems, the exact point at which this matters is up for debate. At interviewing.io we find that before tackling difficult questions, you just need to first start doing problems. **Getting started matters more than attempting to complete a particular question difficulty, so don't focus arbitrarily on medium/hard questions, just focus on practicing**!\n\n**Tip 1: Start with anything. Getting started matters more than picking the perfect set of questions.** For those just starting, you might think, \"I'm a straight-A student and a fast learner, so I should be able to manage hard questions.\" Don't make this mistake, or you'll burn out quickly. Instead, just focus on doing questions and getting into the habit of translating your thoughts into code efficiently.\n\n![probability of faang question difficulty](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fprobability_of_faang_question_difficulty_a08c9d52a1.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nThose who solved more challenging questions needed to do far fewer questions to have the same chance of getting into a FAANG company\n\n\n\n![interviewing io percentile vs total questions by difficulty](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Finterviewing_io_percentile_ee5c50d4f0.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nThose who solved more challenging questions needed to do far fewer questions to have a high interviewing.io percentile\n\nBefore tackling mediums and hards, we need to first get good at easy questions. **Once we can tackle mediums, for each additional 50 questions you complete, you increase your score of passing your interviews by three percentage points.**\n\n**On the other hand, a LeetCode hard carries over *twice* the benefits of a medium question. Completing 50 hard questions increases your interview score by seven percentage points!** Our data shows that you'd need to complete close to 233 medium questions to get the same benefits that 100 hard questions would give. Consider these two people (fictitious but inspired by real examples in our data):\n\n| Question Difficulty | Alex | Kara |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Easy | 50 | 25 |\n| Medium | 630 | 50 |\n| Hard | 10 | 135 |\n| Total | 690 | 210 |\n\nThese two people are statistically likely to have similar interview scores, yet Kara completed half the number of questions Alex did. While it goes against standard advice, harder questions having a higher benefit make sense. A LeetCode medium tends to require you to do one thing (perform a DFS, scan an array, etc.) to get the correct answer. In contrast, hard questions require you to do multiple things (memoize results while performing a DFS, tally prefix sums while scanning an array, etc.). **The compounding nature of multiple tasks in harder questions necessitates deeper learning in fewer questions.**\n\nAdmittedly, there is a chicken-and-egg scenario going on here. Naively, one might think everyone should just do hard questions, but that doesn't work in practice. Jumping straight to hard questions is an infeasible leap for most people, and the reason many people can complete hard questions is precisely *because* they have finished many medium questions first. Our advice is not to jump to hard questions immediately. Instead, you should be mindful and not stay at the medium difficulty level longer than necessary. It isn't that the advice to \"do medium questions\" is wrong\u2014it is just overused. It is natural to want to be able to complete a question regularly in a short period of time. Still, if you find yourself completing LeetCode mediums quickly, it indicates that you have stagnated and would be better off moving on to hards. If you have solved 100 or more medium questions, you'll likely get more bang for your buck by transitioning to hard.\n\n**Tip 2: Don't ignore hard questions.** Balance your medium questions with the hard ones. The compounding nature of multiple tasks in harder questions necessitates deeper learning in fewer questions.\n\nFinally, we must also acknowledge that not all hard questions are created equal. This tip is my gut feeling, and we don't have data to back it up, but intuitively, we've all done hard questions that seem *impossible*, hard questions that seemed like they should have been rated *medium*, and even medium questions that seem like they should have been *hard*. Question difficulty is somewhat subjective, so if you focus on hard questions, choose questions with a high acceptance rating and/or ones that are \"frequently asked.\" These questions tend to be *achievable* (they don't have a single impossible trick you need to just have known), *realistic* (they don't test nonsense algorithms no one knows like Manacher\u2019s algorithm), and *solution-flexible* (there is often more than one valid approach).\n\n**Tip 3: When choosing hard questions, pick popular questions.** They are more likely to be *achievable*, *realistic*, and *solution-flexible*, which will likely result in more learning per question.\n\n### Contests and rankings don't matter\n\nSurprisingly, we found no correlation between LeetCode ratings and their interviewing percentile. Those who were great at contests also didn't appear more likely to have FAANG on their resume. Two confounding variables that might have caused these unexpected results are:\n\n1. **Small contest selection size:** Despite our best efforts, we received a relatively small group of candidates that attended any number of contests, let alone several. The data set may be too small to find a correlation.\n2. **Biased candidate selection:** We incentivized candidates with free interviews, so those who regularly complete contests (and therefore have a lot of practice and likely feel confident in their skills) might not be interested in the rewards and weren't studied in this experiment.\n\n**Tip 4: Don't worry about contests unless you enjoy them.** They provide a way to practice managing your time and keep yourself honest with how fast you are moving, but they don't contribute much to your success apart from containing more questions for you to attempt.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the end, LeetCode questions are a reasonable proxy for predictors of interview performance. While ratings and contest scores don't seem to matter,[1](#user-content-fn-1) questions \u2014and question difficulty\u2014do. Focus on tackling increasingly difficult questions until you've hit that point of diminishing returns near ~500. Don't stagnate with medium questions; pick popular and frequently asked hard questions, too. And don't stress if your friend has a higher LeetCode score than you do; turns out it doesn't mean much!\n\nFootnotes:\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. A caveat here is that, strictly speaking, we're reporting correlations\u2014not necessarily causal relationships. This leaves open the possibility that what we were measuring was not exactly a return to LeetCode but rather the effect of some third variable that increases both LeetCode activity and job prospects. For example, say MIT has a course that emphasizes coding puzzles, and MIT grads also get better jobs. In that case, what might look like a LeetCode benefit is actually an MIT benefit, and controlling for that would make the apparent benefit disappear. At the very least, though, these patterns are informative about the typical profile of successful engineers, which is likely a useful thing to emulate in general. Also, remember that our data still shows solving a healthy number of questions regardless of their difficulty can boost your chances of getting through difficult interviews. By definition, many people can pass interviews with far fewer problems completed, and many will pass after doing more problems. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

What should I do? Advice from an eng manager at Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.\n\nBy Swift Kraken | Published: March 27, 2024\n\n![Author avatar](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fswift_kraken_2_0a2319b378.jpg&w=384&q=75 \"Swift Kraken\")\n\nSwift Kraken\n\nSwift Kraken (the author\u2019s handle on interviewing.io; he asked to remain anonymous for this post) has held engineering management roles at Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. His passion lies in the art of assembling exceptional teams dedicated to crafting outstanding products. The views expressed here are his own and do not represent those of his current or past employers.\n\nThroughout my engineering career, I have encountered the question: *How can I grow myself to get promoted?* I\u2019ve been an engineering manager at Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. I\u2019ve been in many promotion reviews, and here is my advice on what it takes to get a promotion.\n\nThere are three core criteria required to get a promotion:\n\n1. **Readiness**: Are you ready for the promotion? Have you been consistently operating at the next level for a sufficient period of time?\n2. **Perception of readiness** in the organization: Perception matters equally to actual performance \u2014 it is important that your organization perceive you to be performing at the next level.\n3. **Business need**: Let\u2019s assume that there is a clear business need for a higher-level person in the team; otherwise, a promotion won\u2019t take place regardless of your readiness.\n\nThis post will focus on evaluating **Employee Readiness**, and, in a future post I will address the **Perception of Readiness**.\n\nUnderstanding your readiness for the next step in your career is vital. Not getting promoted or missing an opportunity can be frustrating when you\u2019re actually prepared but aren\u2019t actively pushing for advancement. Let me share two examples from my past experience, with names changed for privacy.\n\nMeet Sam, a skilled engineer who could solve complex problems with elegant code. He joined my team feeling frustrated that his previous manager failed to give him the promotion he believed he deserved. Over time, I noticed that Sam focused solely on technical aspects, neglecting how his solutions impacted end-users. In our infrastructure team, responsible for building APIs for internal customers, Sam\u2019s proposals often led to prolonged discussions and missed deadlines. While he saw success in delivering APIs, the organization valued adoption as a key indicator. I coached him to take ownership and understand that just writing APIs wasn\u2019t enough \u2014 he needed to create solutions that aligned with organizational goals.\n\nNext, let\u2019s meet Sara, a friend and a seasoned backend engineer proficient in Java and cloud technologies such as AWS and Azure. She excelled in optimizing backend solutions, showcasing meticulous problem-solving skills. Sara\u2019s expertise lay in crafting efficient and scalable server-side architectures. She led a small project team and mentored junior engineers. She always stayed at the forefront of backend development trends and brought innovative ideas for the team. She was already performing as Staff engineer, but despite her skills, she remained at the same level for a long time. She had self-doubt, and she never asked for the promotion she deserved. I encouraged her to evaluate herself, and we worked together to boost her confidence. It didn\u2019t take long for her to secure the promotion.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to note that not all managers proactively work on helping their employees get promotions; sometimes, you will need to clearly voice your aspirations because louder individuals might overshadow your achievements. In both cases, a clear understanding of readiness for the next level empowered these engineers to take the necessary steps and achieve their career goals.\n\nI\u2019ve put together two brief quizzes to assess your preparedness for the next career level: one for aspiring Senior Engineers and one for aspiring Staff Engineers. These quizzes aim to pinpoint areas where you might need skill development. Disclaimer: Every project, team, and company is unique. These quizzes serve as a general evaluation and may not account for the specific nuance present in each individual situation.\n\n[Quiz: Are you ready to be promoted to Senior Software Engineer?](https://iiosurveys.typeform.com/to/xRlaefap)  \n[Quiz: Are you ready to be promoted to Staff Software Engineer?](https://iiosurveys.typeform.com/to/jjoMSTa1)\n\n*Thanks to [Vivek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vkirub/), [Medha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/immedha/), [Aline](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alinelerner/) and [Liz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liz-graves-95765b114/) for their meticulous proofreading and valuable suggestions in this post!

Here's the data.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: November 10, 2014; Last updated: April 9, 2024\n\n*Note: This post is syndicated from [Aline Lerner\u2019s personal blog](https://blog.alinelerner.com). Aline is the CEO and co-founder of interviewing.io, and results like these are what inspired her to start this company.*\n\nAbout a year ago, after looking at the resumes of engineers we had interviewed at TrialPay in 2012, I learned that the strongest signal for whether someone would get an offer was the [number of typos and grammatical errors on their resume](https://interviewing.io/blog/lessons-from-a-years-worth-of-hiring-data). On the other hand, where people went to school, their GPA, and highest degree earned didn\u2019t matter at all. These results were pretty unexpected, ran counter to how resumes were normally filtered, and left me scratching my head about how good people are at making value judgments based on resumes, period. So, I decided to run an experiment.\n\nIn this experiment, I wanted to see how good engineers and recruiters were at resume-based candidate filtering. **Going into it, I was pretty sure that engineers would do a much better job than recruiters.** (They are technical! They don\u2019t need to rely on proxies as much!) However, that\u2019s not what happened at all. **As it turned out, people were pretty bad at filtering resumes across the board, and after running the numbers, it began to look like resumes might not be a particularly effective filtering tool in the first place.**\n\n## Setup\n\nThe setup was simple. I would:\n\n1. Take resumes from my collection.\n2. Remove all personally identifying info (name, contact info, dates, etc.).\n3. Show them to a bunch of recruiters and engineers.\n4. For each resume, ask just one question: *Would you interview this candidate?*\n\n![Screenshot of a resume filtering form](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsample_stimulus3_b5495fe25f.webp%3Fupdated_at%3D2022-11-21T20%3A18%3A21.787Z&w=1080&q=75 \"Resume filtering\")\n\nEssentially, each participant saw something like this:\n\nIf the participant didn\u2019t want to interview the candidate, they\u2019d have to write a few words about why. If they did want to interview, they also had the option of substantiating their decision, but, in the interest of not fatiguing participants, I didn\u2019t require it.\n\nTo make judging easier, I told participants to pretend that they were hiring for a full-stack or back-end web dev role, as appropriate. I also told participants not to worry too much about the candidate\u2019s seniority when making judgments and to assume that the seniority of the role matched the seniority of the candidate.\n\n**For each resume, I had a pretty good idea of how strong the engineer in question was, and I split resumes into two strength-based groups**. To make this judgment call, I drew on my personal experience \u2014 most of the resumes came from candidates I placed (or tried to place) at top-tier startups. In these cases, I knew exactly how the engineer had done in technical interviews, and, more often than not, I had visibility into how they performed on the job afterwards. The remainder of resumes came from engineers I had worked with directly. **The question was whether the participants in this experiment could figure out who was who just from the resume.**\n\nAt this juncture, a disclaimer is in order. Certainly, someone\u2019s subjective hirability based on the experience of one recruiter is not an oracle of engineering ability \u2014 with the advent of more data and more rigorous analysis, perhaps these results will be proven untrue. But, you gotta start somewhere. That said, here\u2019s the experiment by the numbers.\n\n- I used a total of **51 resumes** in this study. 64% belonged to strong candidates.\n- A total of **152 people** participated in the experiment.\n- **Each participant made judgments on 6 randomly selected resumes** from the original set of 51, for a total of **716 data points**.[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n\nIf you want to take the experiment for a whirl yourself, you can do so [here](https://qtrial2014.az1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_25Gmmef9ktW34A5).\n\nParticipants were broken up into engineers (both engineers involved in hiring and hiring managers themselves) and recruiters (both in-house and agency). There were 46 recruiters (22 in-house and 24 agency) and 106 engineers (20 hiring managers and 86 non-manager engineers who were still involved in hiring).\n\n## Results\n\nSo, what ended up happening? Below, you can see a comparison of resume scores for both groups of candidates. A resume score is the average of all the votes each resume got, where a \u2018no\u2019 counted as 0 and a \u2018yes\u2019 vote counted as 1. The dotted line in each box is the mean for each resume group \u2014 you can see they\u2019re pretty much the same. The solid line is the median, and the boxes contain the 2nd and 3rd quartiles on either side of it. **As you can see, people weren\u2019t very good at this task \u2014 what\u2019s pretty alarming is that scores are all over the place, for both strong and less strong candidates.**\n\nAnother way to look at the data is to look at the distribution of accuracy scores. *Accuracy* in this context refers to how many resumes people were able to tag correctly out of the subset of 6 that they saw. As you can see, results were all over the board.\n\n**On average, participants guessed correctly 53% of the time.** This was pretty surprising, and at the risk of being glib, **according to these results, when a good chunk of people involved in hiring make resume judgments, they might as well be flipping a coin**.\n\n![Cartoon coin toss](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Facb35_tie_coin_toss_1_68afd9383e.webp&w=640&q=75 \"A coin toss\")\n\nSource: <https://what-if.xkcd.com/19/>\n\nWhat about performance broken down by participant group? Here\u2019s the breakdown:\n\n- Agency recruiters \u2013 56%\n- Engineers \u2013 54%\n- In-house recruiters \u2013 52%\n- Eng hiring managers \u2013 48%\n\nNone of the differences between participant groups were statistically significant. In other words, all groups did equally poorly. For each group, you can see how well people did below.\n\n![Charts showing the accuracy of each group](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Faccuracy_charts_8792e468a0.webp%3Fupdated_at%3D2022-11-21T20%3A22%3A06.161Z&w=1920&q=75 \"Accuracy of various groups\")\n\nTo try to understand whether people really were this bad at the task or whether perhaps the task itself was flawed, I ran some more stats. One thing I wanted to understand, in particular, was whether *inter-rater agreement* was high. In other words, when rating resumes, were participants disagreeing with each other more often than you\u2019d expect to happen by chance? **If so, then even if my criteria for whether each resume belonged to a strong candidate wasn\u2019t perfect, the results would still be compelling** \u2014 no matter how you slice it, if people involved in hiring consistently can\u2019t come to a consensus, then something about the task at hand is too ambiguous.\n\nThe test I used to gauge inter-rater agreement is called [Fleiss\u2019 kappa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleiss%27_kappa). The result is on the following scale of -1 to 1:\n\n- *-1* perfect disagreement; no rater agrees with any other\n- 0 random; the raters might as well have been flipping a coin\n- *1* perfect agreement; the raters all agree with one another\n\n**Fleiss\u2019 kappa for this data set was 0.13.** 0.13 is close to zero, implying just mildly better than coin flip. In other words, the task of making value judgments based on these resumes was likely too ambiguous for humans to do well on with the given information alone.\n\n**TL;DR Resumes might actually suck.**\n\n## Some interesting patterns\n\nIn addition to the finding out that people aren\u2019t good at judging resumes, I was able to uncover a few interesting patterns.\n\n### **Times didn\u2019t matter**\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard of and were probably a bit incredulous about [the study](https://info.theladders.com/our-team/you-only-get-6-seconds-of-fame-make-it-count) that showed recruiters spend less than 10 seconds on a resume on average. In this experiment, people took a lot longer to make value judgments. People took a median of 1 minute and 40 seconds per resume. In-house recruiters were fastest, and agency recruiters were slowest. **However, how long someone spent looking at a resume appeared to have no bearing, overall, on whether they\u2019d guess correctly.**\n\n### **Different things mattered to engineers and recruiters**\n\nWhenever a participant deemed a candidate not worth interviewing, they had to substantiate their decision. Though these criteria are clearly not the be-all and end-all of resume filtering \u2014 if they were, people would have done better \u2014 it was interesting to see that engineers and recruiters were looking for different things.[2](#user-content-fn-2)\n\n![Chart showing recruiter's top 5 rejection reasons](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Frecruiter_rejection_reasons_3fd67131ac.webp&w=1200&q=75 \"Recruiter's top 5 rejection reasons\")\n\nIncidentally, *lack of relevant experience* didn\u2019t refer to lack of experience with a specific stack. Verbatim rejection reasons under this category tended to say stuff like \u201cprojects not extensive enough\u201d, \u201clack of core computer science\u201d, or \u201ca lot of academic projects around EE, not a lot on the resume about programming or web development\u201d. *Culture fit* in the engineering graph denotes concerns about engineering culture fit, rather than culture fit overall. This could be anything from concern that someone used to working with Microsoft technologies might not be at home in a RoR shop to worrying that the candidate is too much of a hacker to write clean, maintainable code.\n\n### **Different groups did better on different kinds of resumes**\n\nFirst of all, and not surprisingly, engineers tended to do slightly better on resumes that had projects. Engineers also tended to do better on resumes that included detailed and clear explanations of what the candidate worked on. To get an idea of what I mean by detailed and clear explanations, take a look at the two versions below (source: [Lessons from a year\u2019s worth of hiring data](https://blog.alinelerner.com/lessons-from-a-years-worth-of-hiring-data/ \"Lessons from a year\u2019s worth of hiring data\")). The first description can apply to pretty much any software engineering project, whereas after reading the second, you have a pretty good idea of what the candidate worked on.\n\n![A example of bad description](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbad_description_5b87fee909.webp&w=1920&q=75 \"Bad description\")\n\nA bad description\n\n![An example of a good description](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fgood_description_67fd485b2f.webp&w=1920&q=75 \"Good description\")\n\nA good description\n\nRecruiters, on the other hand, tended to do better with candidates from top companies. This also makes sense. Agency recruiters deal with a huge, disparate candidate set while also dealing with a large number of companies in parallel. They\u2019re going to have a lot of good breadth-first insight including which companies have the highest engineering bar, which companies recently had layoffs, which teams within a specific company are the strongest, and so on.\n\n## Resumes just aren\u2019t that useful\n\nSo, why are people pretty bad at this task? As we saw above, **it may not be a matter of being good or bad at judging resumes but rather a matter of the task itself being flawed \u2014 at the end of the day, the resume is a low-signal document.**\n\nIf we\u2019re honest, no one really knows how to write resumes particularly well. Many people get their first resume writing tips from their university\u2019s career services department, which is staffed with people who\u2019ve never held a job in the field they\u2019re advising for. Shit, some of the most fervent resume advice I ever got was from a technical recruiter, who insisted that I list every technology I\u2019d ever worked with on every single undergrad research project I\u2019d ever done. I left his office in a cold sweaty panic, desperately trying to remember what version of Apache MIT had been running at the time.\n\nVery smart people, who are otherwise fantastic writers, seem to check every ounce of intuition and personality at the door and churn out soulless documents expounding their experience with the software development life cycle or whatever\u2026 because they\u2019re scared that sounding like a human being on their resume or not peppering it with enough keywords will eliminate them from the applicant pool before an engineer even has the chance to look at it.\n\nWriting aside, reading resumes is a shitty and largely thankless task. If it\u2019s not your job, it\u2019s a distraction that you want to get over with so you can go back to writing code. And if it is your job, you probably have a huge stack to get through, so it\u2019s going to be hard to do deep dives into people\u2019s work and projects, even if you\u2019re technical enough to understand them, provided they even include links to their work in the first place. On top of that, spending more time on a given resume may not even yield a more accurate result, at least according to what I observed in this study.\n\n## How to fix top-of-the-funnel filtering\n\nAssuming that my results are reproducible and people, across the board, are really quite bad at filtering resumes, there are a few things we can do to make top-of-the-funnel filtering better. In the short term, improving collaboration across different teams involved in hiring is a good start. As we saw, engineers are better at judging certain kinds of resumes, and recruiters are better at others. If a resume has projects or a GitHub account with content listed, passing it over to an engineer to get a second opinion is probably a good idea. And if a candidate is coming from a company with a strong brand, but one that you\u2019re not too familiar with, getting some insider info from a recruiter might not be the worst thing.\n\n**Longer-term, how engineers are filtered fundamentally needs to change.** In my [TrialPay study](https://blog.alinelerner.com/lessons-from-a-years-worth-of-hiring-data/ \"Lessons from a year\u2019s worth of hiring data\"), I found that, in addition to grammatical errors, one of the things that mattered most was how clearly people described their work. In this study, I found that engineers were better at making judgments on resumes that included these kinds of descriptions. Given these findings, relying more heavily on a writing sample during the filtering process might be in order. For the writing sample, I am imagining something that isn\u2019t a cover letter \u2014 people tend to make those pretty formulaic and don\u2019t talk about anything too personal or interesting. Rather, it should be a concise description of something you worked on recently that you are excited to talk about, as explained to a non-technical audience. I think the non-technical audience aspect is critical because if you can break down complex concepts for a layman to understand, you\u2019re probably a good communicator and actually understand what you worked on. Moreover, recruiters could actually read this description and make valuable judgments about whether the writing is good and whether they understand what the person did.\n\nHonestly, I really hope that the resume dies a grisly death. One of the coolest things about coding is that it doesn\u2019t take much time/effort to determine if someone can perform above some minimum threshold \u2014 all you need is the internets and a code editor. Of course, figuring out if someone is great is tough and takes more time, but figuring out if someone meets a minimum standard, mind you the same kind of minimum standard we\u2019re trying to meet when we go through a pile of resumes, is pretty damn fast. And in light of this, relying on low-signal proxies doesn\u2019t make sense at all.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nA huge thank you to:\n\n- All the engineers who let me use their resumes for this experiment\n- Everyone who participated and took the time to judge resumes\n- The fine people at [Statwing](https://www.statwing.com) and [Plotly](https://plot.ly)\n- [Stan Le](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/stan-le/44/aa2/435) for doing all the behind-the-scenes work that made running this experiment possible\n- All the smart people who were kind enough to proofread this behemoth\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1.

Here\u2019s what happened.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: June 28, 2016; Last updated: May 1, 2024\n\n[interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/) is a platform where people can practice technical interviewing anonymously and, in the process, find jobs based on their interview performance rather than their resumes. Since we started, we\u2019ve amassed data from thousands of technical interviews, and in this blog, we routinely share some of the surprising stuff we\u2019ve learned. In this post, I\u2019ll talk about what happened when we built real-time voice masking to investigate the magnitude of bias against women in technical interviews. **In short, we made men sound like women and women sound like men and looked at how that affected their interview performance. We also looked at what happened when women did poorly in interviews, how drastically that differed from men\u2019s behavior, and why that difference matters for the thorny issue of the gender gap in tech.**\n\n## The setup\n\nWhen an interviewer and an interviewee match on our platform, they meet in a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard and jump right into a technical question. Interview questions on the platform tend to fall into the category of what you\u2019d encounter at a phone screen for a back-end software engineering role, and interviewers typically come from a mix of large companies like Google, Facebook, Twitch, and Yelp, as well as engineering-focused startups like Asana, Mattermark, and others. For more context, some examples of interviews done on the platform can be found on our [mock interview](https://interviewing.io/mocks) page.\n\nAfter every interview, interviewers rate interviewees on a few different dimensions.\n\n![Feedback form for interviewers](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fpseudonym_survey_86e6399c78.png&w=1200&q=75 \"Interviewer feedback form\")\n\nAs you can see, we ask the interviewer if they would advance their interviewee to the next round. We also ask about a few different aspects of interview performance using a 1-4 scale. On our platform, a score of 3 or above is generally considered good.\n\n## Women historically haven\u2019t performed as well as men\u2026\n\nOne of the big motivators to think about voice masking was the increasingly uncomfortable disparity in interview performance on the platform between men and women.[1](#user-content-fn-1) At that time, we had amassed over a thousand interviews with enough data to do some comparisons and were surprised to discover that women really were doing worse. Specifically, **men were getting advanced to the next round 1.4 times more often than women. Interviewee technical score wasn\u2019t faring that well either \u2014 men on the platform had an average technical score of 3 out of 4, as compared to a 2.5 out of 4 for women**.\n\nDespite these numbers, it was really difficult for me to believe that women were just somehow worse at computers, so when some of our customers asked us to build voice masking to see if that would make a difference in the conversion rates of female candidates, we didn\u2019t need much convincing.\n\n## ...so we built voice masking\n\nSince we started working on interviewing.io, in order to achieve true interviewee anonymity, we knew that hiding gender would be something we\u2019d have to deal with eventually but put it off for a while because it wasn\u2019t technically trivial to build a real-time voice modulator. Some early ideas included sending female users a Bane mask.\n\n![Cartoon of the character Bane pretending to be Batman](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1186d_bane_72ee94351f.webp&w=640&q=75 \"Early voice masking prototype\")\n\nWhen the Bane mask thing didn\u2019t work out, we decided we ought to build something within the app, and if you play the videos below, you can get an idea of what voice masking on interviewing.io sounds like. In the first one, I\u2019m talking in my normal voice.\n\nAnd in the second one, I\u2019m modulated to sound like a man.[2](#user-content-fn-2)\n\nArmed with the ability to hide gender during technical interviews, we were eager to see what the hell was going on and get some insight into why women were consistently underperforming.\n\n## The experiment\n\nThe setup for our experiment was simple. Every Tuesday evening at 7 PM Pacific, interviewing.io hosts what we call practice rounds. In these practice rounds, anyone with an account can show up, get matched with an interviewer, and go to town. And during a few of these rounds, **we decided to see what would happen to interviewees\u2019 performance when we started messing with their perceived genders**.\n\nIn the spirit of not giving away what we were doing and potentially compromising the experiment, we told both interviewees and interviewers that we were slowly rolling out our new voice masking feature and that they could opt in or out of helping us test it out. Most people opted in, and we informed interviewees that their voice might be masked during a given round and asked them to refrain from sharing their gender with their interviewers. For interviewers, we simply told them that interviewee voices might sound a bit processed.\n\nWe ended up with 234 total interviews (roughly 2/3 male and 1/3 female interviewees), which fell into one of three categories:\n\n- Completely unmodulated (useful as a baseline)\n- Modulated without pitch change\n- Modulated with pitch change\n\nYou might ask why we included the second condition, i.e. modulated interviews that didn\u2019t change the interviewee\u2019s pitch. As you probably noticed, if you played the videos above, the modulated one sounds fairly processed. The last thing we wanted was for interviewers to assume that any processed-sounding interviewee must summarily have been the opposite gender of what they sounded like. So we threw that condition in as a further control.\n\n## The results\n\nAfter running the experiment, we ended up with some rather surprising results. **Contrary to what we expected** (and probably contrary to what you expected as well!), **masking gender had no effect on interview performance** with respect to any of the scoring criteria (would advance to next round, technical ability, problem solving ability). If anything, we started to notice some trends in the opposite direction of what we expected: for technical ability, it appeared that men who were modulated to sound like women did a bit better than unmodulated men and that women who were modulated to sound like men did a bit worse than unmodulated women. Though these trends weren\u2019t statistically significant, I am mentioning them because they were unexpected and definitely something to watch for as we collect more data.\n\nOn the subject of sample size, we have no delusions that this is the be-all and end-all of pronouncements on the subject of gender and interview performance. We\u2019ll continue to monitor the data as we collect more of it, and it\u2019s very possible that as we do, everything we\u2019ve found will be overturned. I will say, though, that had there been any staggering gender bias on the platform, with a few hundred data points, we would have gotten some kind of result. So that, at least, was encouraging.\n\n## So if there\u2019s no systemic bias, why are women performing worse?\n\nAfter the experiment was over, I was left scratching my head. If the issue wasn\u2019t interviewer bias, what could it be? I went back and looked at the seniority levels of men vs. women on the platform as well as the kind of work they were doing in their current jobs, and neither of those factors seemed to differ significantly between groups. But there was one nagging thing in the back of my mind. I spend a lot of my time poring over interview data, and I had noticed something peculiar when observing the behavior of female interviewees. Anecdotally, it seemed like women were leaving the platform a lot more often than men. So I ran the numbers.\n\nWhat I learned was pretty shocking. **As it happens, women leave interviewing.io roughly 7 times as often as men after they do badly in an interview.** And the numbers for two bad interviews aren\u2019t much better. You can see the breakdown of attrition by gender below (the differences between men and women are indeed statistically significant with P < 0.00001).\n\nAlso note that as much as possible, I corrected for people leaving the platform because they found a job (practicing interviewing isn\u2019t that fun after all, so you\u2019re probably only going to do it if you\u2019re still looking), were just trying out the platform out of curiosity, or they didn\u2019t like something else about their interviewing.io experience.\n\n## A totally speculative thought experiment\n\nSo, if these are the kinds of behaviors that happen in the interviewing.io microcosm, how much is applicable to the broader world of software engineering? Please bear with me as I wax hypothetical and try to extrapolate what we\u2019ve seen here to our industry at large. And also, please know that what follows is very speculative, based on not that much data, and could be totally wrong\u2026 but you gotta start somewhere.\n\nIf you consider the attrition data points above, you might want to do what any reasonable person would do in the face of an existential or moral quandary, i.e. fit the data to a curve. An exponential decay curve seemed reasonable for attrition behavior, and you can see what I came up with below. The x-axis is the number of what I like to call \u201cattrition events\u201d, namely things that might happen to you over the course of your computer science studies and subsequent career that might make you want to quit. The y-axis is what portion of people are left after each attrition event. The red curve denotes women, and the blue curve denotes men.\n\n![Chart showing the gender gap](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe92a1_gender_gap_v2_d243a94167.webp%3Fupdated_at%3D2022-12-08T14%3A31%3A14.044Z&w=1920&q=75 \"Thar be gender gap\")\n\nSee interactive graph with Demos: <https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tugmyjkaj6>\n\nNow, as I said, this is pretty speculative, but it really got me thinking about what these curves might mean in the broader context of women in computer science. How many \u201cattrition events\u201d does one encounter between primary and secondary education and entering a collegiate program in CS and then starting to embark on a career? So, I don\u2019t know, let\u2019s say there are 8 of these events between getting into programming and looking around for a job. If that\u2019s true, then we need 3 times as many women studying computer science than men to get to the same number in our pipelines. Note that that\u2019s 3 times more than men, not 3 times more than there are now. If we think about how many there are now, which, depending on your source, is between 1/3 and a 1/4 of the number of men, **to get to pipeline parity, we actually have to increase the number of women studying computer science by an entire order of magnitude**.\n\n## Prior art, or why maybe this isn\u2019t so nuts after all\n\nSince gathering these findings and starting to talk about them a bit in the community, I began to realize that there was some supremely interesting academic work being done on gender differences around self-perception, confidence, and performance. Some of the work below found slightly different trends than we did, but it\u2019s clear that anyone attempting to answer the question of the gender gap in tech would be remiss in not considering the effects of confidence and self-perception in addition to the more salient matter of bias.\n\nIn a [study investigating the effects of perceived performance to likelihood of subsequent engagement](https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/252/2014/10/EhrlingerDunning2003.pdf), Dunning (of Dunning-Kruger fame) and Ehrlinger administered a scientific reasoning test to male and female undergrads and then asked them how they did. Not surprisingly, though there was no difference in performance between genders, women underrated their own performance more often than men. Afterwards, participants were asked whether they\u2019d like to enter a Science Jeopardy contest on campus in which they could win cash prizes. Again, women were significantly less likely to participate, with participation likelihood being directly correlated with self-perception rather than actual performance.[3](#user-content-fn-3)\n\nIn a different study, [sociologists followed a number of male and female STEM students over the course of their college careers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232564809_The_Validity_and_Utility_of_Selection_Methods_in_Personnel_Psychology) via diary entries authored by the students. One prevailing trend that emerged immediately was the difference between how men and women handled the \u201cdiscovery of their [place in the] pecking order of talent, an initiation that is typical of socialization across the professions.\u201d For women, realizing that they may no longer be at the top of the class and that there were others who were performing better, \u201cthe experience [triggered] a more fundamental doubt about their abilities to master the technical constructs of engineering expertise [than men].\u201d\n\nAnd of course, what survey of gender difference research would be complete without an allusion to the wretched annals of dating? When I told the interviewing.io team about the disparity in attrition between genders, the resounding response was along the lines of, \u201cWell, yeah. Just think about dating from a man\u2019s perspective.\u201d Indeed, [a study published in the *Archives of Sexual Behavior*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:ASEB.0000028892.63150.be) confirms that men treat rejection in dating very differently than women, even going so far as to say that men \u201creported they would experience a more positive than negative affective response after\u2026 being sexually rejected.\u201d\n\nMaybe tying coding to sex is a bit tenuous, but, as they say, programming is like sex \u2014 one mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life.\n\n## Why I\u2019m not depressed by our results and why you shouldn\u2019t be either\n\nPrior art aside, I would like to leave off on a high note. I mentioned earlier that men are doing a lot better on the platform than women, but here\u2019s the startling thing. **Once you factor out interview data from both men and women who quit after one or two bad interviews, the disparity goes away entirely.** So while the attrition numbers aren\u2019t great, I\u2019m massively encouraged by the fact that at least in these findings, it\u2019s not about systemic bias against women or women being bad at computers or whatever. Rather, it\u2019s about women being bad at dusting themselves off after failing, which, despite everything, is probably a lot easier to fix.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. Roughly 15% of our users are female. We want way more, but it\u2019s a start. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n2. If you want to hear more examples of voice modulation or are just generously down to indulge me in some shameless bragging, we got to demo it on [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2016/04/12/473912220/blind-hiring-while-well-meaning-may-create-unintended-consequences) and in [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/3059522/this-interviewing-platform-changes-your-voice-to-eliminate-unconscious-bias). [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-2)\n3. In addition to asking interviewers how interviewees did, [we also ask interviewees to rate themselves](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8ddad_interviewee_feedback_be549dadfb.png). After reading the Dunning and Ehrlinger study, we went back and checked to see what role self-perception played in attrition. In our case, the answer is, I\u2019m afraid, TBD, as we\u2019re going to need more self-ratings to say anything conclusive. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-3)\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

In my mind, as long as employers were obsessed with where people had gone to school and worked previously, instead of focusing on what people could actually do, hiring would stay broken.\n\nSo, we set out to build a better system. On our platform, you get mock interviews with senior engineers who\u2019ve been involved in hiring decisions at top companies. If you do well in practice, you get to bypass recruiter calls and resume screens and instantly book real technical interviews at top companies, as early as tomorrow, regardless of how you look on paper. *Real interviews are also* completely anonymous, and because we use interview data, not resumes, our candidates end up getting hired consistently by companies like Facebook, Uber, Amazon, Lyft, Dropbox, and many others, and 40% of the hires we\u2019ve made to date have been candidates from non-traditional backgrounds (many were literally rejected from the same company when they went through the front door and someone saw their resume\u2026 only when they got to interview anonymously did they get the chance to show what they could do).\n\nHere\u2019s a new video we made explaining what we do. People don\u2019t usually believe us when we explain it in words (\u201c*Wait, what, you can book a real interview at Amazon tomorrow? What\u2019s the catch?\u201d*), so here are some nice animations. It\u2019s real, we promise, and it works.\n\nFor most of our lifetime, practicing on our platform was completely free for engineers \u2014 you could get paired up with a professional interviewer (a senior engineer from a FAANG or FAANG-adjacent company) and do 3 mock interviews completely on us. This model worked pretty well because we monetized employers who wanted to hire our top-performing users, and the proceeds went to paying our awesome professional interviewers.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t perfect. To keep our costs manageable, we had to cap people at 3 mock interviews, and we had to waitlist a lot of people because either they weren\u2019t experienced enough (despite our best efforts, we couldn\u2019t get companies to pay us for access to junior engineers) or because they weren\u2019t looking for jobs in our target locations.\n\nThen COVID-19 happened and with it, a deluge of layoffs, hiring slowdowns, and freezes. We found ourselves down from 7-figure revenue to nothing. Companies didn\u2019t really want or need to pay for hiring anymore.\n\nIf we wanted to keep offering practice in this climate, while still being able to pay our interviewers, we needed to find another revenue stream. After the quarantine began, we made the very hard call to start charging people for practice. But, charging felt anathema to our mission, so we also made a [public promise back in June of 2020](https://interviewing.io/blog/interviewing-io-is-out-of-beta-anonymous-technical-interview-practice-for-all) to launch a program in the future where engineers could defer paying for practice til they found a job.\n\nToday, we\u2019re making good on that promise by launching our Pay Later Program.\n\n## What is the Pay Later Program?\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n\n- **You get $512 or $1024 to spend on mock interviews.** Other than being cute powers of 2, we chose these numbers because our data shows that [after 5 mock interviews, your chances of passing real interviews will double](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-know-ready-interview-faang), so we wanted to get people enough practice to make a difference in their outcomes.\n- You put down a credit card and promise to pay us when you find a new job. There\u2019s no interest and no gotchas, and enrolling is really as simple as putting down a card and promising not to screw us over.\n- We check in with you in 4 months (most of our users find jobs within 4 months of starting to practice). **If you\u2019ve found a new job, great, we charge you, and any unused credits are yours to keep. If you have not, no worries, we grant you an extension** (and keep granting you extensions til you\u2019ve found a job).\n- Here\u2019s the best part. **If you find a job through interviewing.io with one of our employer partners, then you don\u2019t have to pay us anything!** (If you\u2019re not part of the Pay Later program and you find a job through us, we *still* refund all the $$ you spent on practice.)\n\n## Who\u2019s it good for?\n\nThe Pay Later Program is available to all of our users who are authorized to work in the US, Canada, the UK, and Australia. We\u2019ll be rolling out in other countries as we go.\n\nBeyond that one criterion, this program is for any engineer or aspiring engineer who will be interviewing in the near to medium-term future. We know how much practicing for technical interviews sucks. If you\u2019re a junior engineer, it\u2019s scary because you haven\u2019t done it before. If you haven\u2019t come from a traditional computer science background, and especially if you\u2019re coming out of a bootcamp, it\u2019s scary because, chances are, you haven\u2019t been taught this material properly (bootcamps aren\u2019t good at this, sorry).\n\nAnd if you\u2019re an experienced engineer, interviews are scary because they\u2019re not the work that you do every day, and ironically, the more experienced you are, the worse you do in these interviews, even as the bar keeps getting higher and higher.\n\nBelow you can see the seniority of users currently enrolled in our program:\n\n![Chart showing seniority of users enrolled in interviewing.io's Pay Later Program](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FSeniority_of_users_enrolled_in_interviewing_ios_Pay_Later_Program_ee3a6ea4ab.png&w=750&q=75 \"Pay Later Program participant seniority\")\n\nIf you need interview practice, whether you\u2019re junior or experienced, whether you look good on paper or not, you should sign up, and you\u2019ll get value out of it. Whether you don\u2019t have the $$ now or whether you\u2019re just not sure if the investment is worth it, this program is for you.\n\n## Does it really work?\n\nYes! The majority (over 80% of our users find jobs in 4 months or less), and by the 6 month mark, 94% of our users are employed. Here are some testimonials from our users. It was hard to pick which ones to share. We have a lot.\n\n> *I love your platform, and you can confirm I use it all the time! I push using your platform as the #1 advice when anyone I mentor asks me for \u2018prep advice\u2019. I always tell them: \u201cWhen you have that job at Google and all that stock, won\u2019t you think the paid prep was worth it?\u201d*\n\n> *Your program has definitely changed my life. I was able to use some of my signing bonus to buy a home in the DC area, so this work is really starting to pay off.*\n\n> *I can\u2019t speak highly enough of the [Pay Later] program. As an engineer looking to make a jump, the mock interviews are an invaluable practice resource. Being able to utilize the mock interviews even before getting that really well-paying job, is life-changing. It gave me access to a resource which literally catapulted my career in ways I could only vaguely imagine a year ago. I really hope they keep the program around to help others who aren\u2019t yet flush with cash.*\n\n> *My experience with interviewing.io was awesome. I used the Pay Later program to schedule six practice interviews, which led to offers from my top targets: Google, Pinterest, Airtable and Stripe. It is hard to simulate an actual interview while using Leetcode, and I definitely feel the practice interviews were a key factor in the success I had during technical interviews throughout my job search.*\n\n> *I signed up for the [Pay Later] program as I worked on transitioning from teaching high school to software engineering. The program seemed like a no-brainer. I could get all of the excellent practice opportunities I needed and I would only have to pay for the service after I landed a new job. A job which would nearly double my previous salary.*\n\n> *interviewing.io\u2019s [Pay Later] program was a godsend for me. I was not in the best place financially (as a job seeker does) and I needed the practice to improve my interviewing skills. Of all the platforms that I have tried, the most engaging and the most helpful is interviewing.io. They are so patient with the deferral process and I even received my current job through the platform!*\n\n> *My mock interviews on interviewing.io were instrumental in my preparation for my latest job search. I also really appreciated the flexible payment options they were offering during the pandemic. Every mock left with me specific, actionable feedback that I could apply to my next phone screen, and it didn\u2019t take long to see serious improvements in my performance, and the number of onsites I was booking. Eventually, I accepted an offer from Facebook, even with no degree and limited field experience. Sincerely, I can\u2019t thank your team enough for helping make this dream of mine come true!*\n\n> *Prior to using interviewing.io, I had been very discouraged and frustrated when I was constantly rejected after on-site interviews and not knowing what I did wrong or where to improve. To give it a perspective, I found myself clearing 90% of the phone screens but receiving a rejection after the onsite interviews. Even though there are lots of interview preparation resources out there such as Leetcode, AlgoExpert, Growking the Coding Interview, none of them truly bridges the gap between my technical knowledge and the interview expectation. The feedback provided by the professional interviewers during the mock interviews were extremely helpful as they provided points of improvement on areas I have never thought of. On top of all, the deferral program really provided me a risk free and worry free opportunity to try out the platform.*\n\n> *I just cleared Amazon and Google interviews. I have a learning disability and social phobia. Prior to using interviewing.io I had never gotten past the technical phone screens. Getting in the habit of doing back to back interviews every weekend helped with both anxiety and getting better at timing myself to solve all problems within 45 min. $600 owed in a couple of months\u2026 will have been worth it 100x over \ud83d\ude0a*\n\n> *I think the practice at interviewing.io really helped me land a job at Google. The interviewers were professional and really improved my communication skills during the interview. Since each mock interview is structured just like a real interview, I got more familiarized with the environment and the process. The feedback helped me strengthen my foundation and make up for parts that I missed. Especially with the [Pay Later] program, I could afford the charges as a poor student\u2026 it felt like interviewing.io had trust in me and this really boosted my confidence.*\n\n> *After I got laid off from my job, I greatly appreciated the opportunity to be a part of the [Pay Later] program. (I found something within the 4 month window!) The interview practice prepared me for my actual technical interviews and helped me approach my technical interviews with confidence. I got a lot of good feedback about how I could improve my presentation during a living coding session. Being able to listen to live recordings of my coding sessions was painful, but enlightening. My interviewers were helpful and asked tailored questions and gave useful feedback. I\u2019ve recommended this to all of my friends who are looking for software engineering jobs.*\n\n> *I absolutely loved the program. It allowed me to focus my energy on preparing myself for my technical interviews, instead of worrying about the cost of my practice. The mock interviews allowed me to get comfortable in a real interview environment, which helped me pass the interviews at Facebook, Google, Amazon, and more!*\n\n> *Ended up getting a few offers but went with Google! I\u2019m from a non-CS/non-SWE background and without a doubt, your platform helped tremendously with landing these offers. Additionally, the deferral program is a fantastic idea\u2026 I really appreciate what you are trying to do with interviewing.io and also with shaping the broader interview process. Keep up the great work!!*\n\n> *My experience with the [Pay Later] program was great. I felt a bit anxious spending money initially on the site without the guarantee of receiving a job offer, [but the] flexibility the program offered to me both made me feel comfortable opting into the program as well as gave me the chance to get quality interviews that helped me receive a job. [The program offered] both offered a vital resource to me while also giving me comfort knowing that I wouldn\u2019t need to worry about the cost until I achieved the goal of the program. If I were ever in the need of more mock interviews, interviewing.io would\u2026 be my first choice of sites to visit.*\n\n> *I am happy to share with you that I was offered the software engineering position at Facebook that I had been preparing for. Your assistance through the [Pay Later] payment program and the mock interviews I utilized (both general and company-specific) were an integral part of my outcome as I received feedback on my interview performance that I had only ever guessed at. I am so grateful for the opportunity to have been able to do the deferred payment arrangement with Interviewing.io since I would\u2019ve foregone paid mock interviews otherwise!*\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

Study time crowds out personal time, to the point where he basically has no life beyond work and interview prep.\n\n\u201cIt keeps me up at night: what if I get zero offers? What if I spent all this time, and it was all for naught?\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve all been through the job search, and many of us have found ourselves in a similar emotional state. But why is Recursive Cactus investing so much time, and what\u2019s the source of this frustration?\n\nHe feels he can\u2019t meet the engineer hiring bar (aka \u201cThe Bar\u201d), that generally accepted minimum level of competency that all engineers must exhibit to get hired.\n\nTo meet \u201cThe Bar,\u201d he\u2019s chosen a specific tactic: to look like the engineer that people want, rather than just be the engineer that he is.\n\nIt seems silly to purposefully pretend to be someone you\u2019re not. But if we want to understand why Recursive Cactus acts the way he does, it helps to know what \u201cThe Bar\u201d actually is. And when you think a little more about it, you realize there\u2019s not such a clear definition.\n\n## Defining \u201cThe Bar\u201d\n\nWhat if we look at how the [FAANG companies (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google)](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-know-ready-interview-faang) define \u201cThe Bar?\u201d After all, it seems those companies receive the most attention from pretty much everybody, job seekers included.\n\nFew of them disclose specific details about their hiring process. Apple doesn\u2019t publicly share any information. [Facebook](https://www.facebookcareers.com/facebook-life/how-we-hire/?page=1) describes the stages of their interview process, but not their assessment criteria. [Netflix](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/assessments) both say they hire candidates that fit their work culture/leadership principles. Neither Netflix nor Amazon describes exactly how they assess against their respective principles. However, Amazon does share how interviews get conducted as well as software [topics that could be discussed for software developer](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/software-development-topics) positions.\n\nThe most transparent of all FAANGs, [Google publicly discloses](https://careers.google.com/how-we-hire/interview/) its interview process with the most detail, with Laszlo Bock\u2019s book [*Work Rules!*](https://www.amazon.com/Work-Rules-Insights-Inside-Transform/dp/1455554790) adding even more insider color about how their interview process came to be.\n\nAnd speaking of tech titans and the recent past, Aline (our founder) mentioned the 2003 book [*How Would You Move Mount Fuji?*](https://www.amazon.com/How-Would-Move-Mount-Fuji-ebook/dp/B000Q67H6I) in a prior [blog post,](https://interviewing.io/blog/you-cant-fix-diversity-in-tech-without-fixing-the-technical-interview) which recounted Microsoft\u2019s interview process when they were the pre-eminent tech behemoth of the time.\n\nIn order to get a few more data points about how companies assess candidates, I also looked at Gayle Laakmann McDowell\u2019s \u201cCracking the Coding Interview\u201d, which is effectively the Bible of interviewing for prospective candidates, as well as Joel Spolsky\u2019s [Guerilla Guide to Interviewing 3.0](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/), written by an influential and well-known figure within tech circles over the past 20-30 years.\n\n### Definitions of \u201cThe Bar\u201d\n\n| **Source** | **Assessment Criteria** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Apple | Not publicly shared |\n| [Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/assessments) | Assessed against [Amazon\u2019s Leadership principles](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles) |\n| Facebook | Not publicly shared |\n| Netflix | Not publicly shared |\n| [Google](https://careers.google.com/how-we-hire/interview/#onsite-interviews) | 1.

After all, that is the job.\n\nBut beyond that, the most common criteria shared among all these entities is a concept of intelligence. Though they use different words and define the terms slightly differently, all point to some notion of what psychologies call \u201ccognitive ability.\u201d\n\n| **Source** | **Definition of cognitive ability** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Google | *\u201cGeneral Cognitive Ability. Not surprisingly, we want smart people who can learn and adapt to new situations. Remember that this is about understanding how candidates have solved hard problems in real life and how they learn, not checking GPAs and SATs.\u201d* |\n| Microsoft (circa 2003) | *\u201cThe goal of Microsoft\u2019s interviews is to assess a general problem-solving ability rather than a specific competency\u2026 It is rarely dear what type of reasoning is required or what the precise limits of the problem are. The solver must nonetheless persist until it is possible to bring the analysis to a timely and successful conclusion.\u201d* |\n| Joel Spolsky | *\u201cFor some reason most people seem to be born without the part of the brain that understands pointers.\u201d* |\n| Gayle Laakmann McDowell | *\u201cIf you\u2019re able to work through several hard problems (with some help, perhaps), you\u2019re probably pretty good at developing optimal algorithms. You\u2019re smart.\u201d* |\n\nAll these definitions of intelligence resemble early 19th-century psychologist [Charles Spearman\u2019s theory of intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_theory_of_intelligence), the most widely acknowledged framework for intelligence. After performing a series of cognitive tests on school children, Spearman found that those who did well in one type of test tended to also perform well in other tests. This insight led Spearman to theorize that there exists a single underlying general ability factor (called \u201cg\u201d or \u201cg factor\u201d) influencing all performance, separate from specific, task-specific abilities (named \u201cs\u201d).\n\nIf you believe in the existence of \u201cg\u201d (many do, some do not\u2026 there exist [different theories of intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences)), finding candidates with high measures of \u201cg\u201d aligns neatly with the intelligence criteria companies look for.\n\nWhile criteria like leadership and culture fit matter to companies, \u201cThe Bar\u201d is not usually defined in those terms. **\u201cThe Bar\u201d is defined as having technical skills but also (and perhaps more so) having general intelligence.** After all, candidates aren\u2019t typically coming to interviewing.io to specifically practice leadership and culture fit.\n\nThe question then becomes how you measure these two things. Measuring technical skills seems tough but doable, but how do you measure \u201cg?\u201d\n\n## Measuring general intelligence\n\nMentioned in Bock\u2019s book, Frank Schmidt\u2019s and John Hunter\u2019s 1998 paper \u201c[The Validity and Utility of Selection Methods in Personnel Psychology](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232564809_The_Validity_and_Utility_of_Selection_Methods_in_Personnel_Psychology)\u201d attempted to answer this question by analyzing a diverse set of 19 candidate selection criteria to see which predicted future job performance the best. The authors concluded general mental ability (GMA) best predicted job performance based on a statistic called \u201cpredictive validity.\u201d\n\n![Table showing candidate selection criteria and validity in predicting job performance](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F4_Table1_1_bd3ec75215.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Candidate selection criteria and validity in predicting job performance\")\n\nIn this study, a GMA test referred to an IQ test. But for Microsoft circa 2003, puzzle questions like \u201cHow many piano tuners are there in the world?\u201d appear to have taken the place of IQ tests for measuring \u201cg\u201d. Their reasoning:\n\n> *\u201cAt Microsoft, and now at many other companies, it is believed that there are parallels between the reasoning used to solve puzzles and the thought processes involved in solving the real problems of innovation and a changing marketplace. Both the solver of a puzzle and a technical innovator must be able to identify essential elements in a situation that is initially ill-defined.\u201d*\n>\n> \u2013 \u201cHow Would You Move Mount Fuji?\u201d \u2013 page 20\n\nFast forward to today, Google [denounces this practice](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/hiring-use-structured-interviewing/steps/avoid-brainteasers/), concluding that \u201cperformance on these kinds of questions is at best a discrete skill that can be improved through practice, eliminating their utility for assessing candidates.\u201d\n\nSo here we have two companies who test for general intelligence, but who also fundamentally disagree on how to measure it.\n\n## Are we measuring specific or general intelligence?\n\nBut maybe as Spolsky and McDowell have argued, the traditional algorithmic and computer science-based interview questions are themselves effective tests for general intelligence. Hunter & Schmidt\u2019s study contains some data points that could support this line of reasoning. Among all single-criteria assessment tools, work sample tests possessed the highest predictive validity. Additionally, when observing the highest validity regression result of two-criteria assessment tool (GMA test plus work sample test), the standardized effect size on the work sample rating was larger than that of the GMA rating, suggesting a stronger relationship with future job performance.\n\nIf you believe algorithmic exercises function as work sample tests in interviews, then the study suggests traditional algorithm-based interviews could predict future job performance, maybe even more than a GMA/IQ test.\n\nRecursive Cactus doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s a connection.\n\n> *There\u2019s little overlap between the knowledge acquired on the job and knowledge about solving algorithmic questions. Most engineers rarely work with graph algorithms or dynamic programming. In application programming, lists and dictionary-like objects are the most common data structures. However, interview questions involving those are often seen as trivial, hence the focus on other categories of problems.*\n>\n> \u2013 Recursive Cactus\n\nIn his view, algorithms questions are similar to Microsoft\u2019s puzzle questions: you learn how to get good at solving interview problems, which to him don\u2019t ever show up in actual day-to-day work, which, if true, wouldn\u2019t actually fit with the Schmidt & Hunter study.\n\nDespite Recursive Cactus\u2019s personal beliefs, interviewers like Spolsky still believe these skills are vital to being a productive programmer.\n\n> *A lot of programmers that you might interview these days are apt to consider recursion, pointers, and even data structures to be a silly implementation detail which has been abstracted away by today\u2019s many happy programming languages. \u201cWhen was the last time you had to write a sorting algorithm?\u201d they snicker.*\n>\n> *Still, I don\u2019t really care. I want my ER doctor to understand anatomy, even if all she has to do is put the computerized defibrillator nodes on my chest and push the big red button, and I want programmers to know programming down to the CPU level, even if Ruby on Rails does read your mind and build a complete Web 2.0 social collaborative networking site for you with three clicks of the mouse.*\n>\n> \u2013 Joel Spolsky\n\nSpolsky seems to concede that traditional tech interview questions might not mimic actual work problems, and therefore wouldn\u2019t act as work samples. Rather, it seems he\u2019s testing for general computer science aptitude, which is general in a way, but specific in other ways. General intelligence within a specific domain, one might say.\n\nThat is, unless you believe intelligence in computer science *is* general intelligence. McDowell suggests this:\n\n> *There\u2019s another reason why data structure and algorithm knowledge comes up: because it\u2019s hard to ask problem-solving questions that don\u2019t involve them. It turns out that the vast majority of problem-solving questions involve some of these basics.*\n>\n> \u2013 Gayle Laakmann McDowell\n\nThis could be true assuming you view the world primarily through computer science lenses. Still, it seems pretty restrictive to suggest people who don\u2019t speak the language of computer science would have more difficulty solving problems.\n\nAt this point, we\u2019re not really talking about measuring general intelligence as Spearman originally defined it. Rather, it seems we\u2019re talking about specific intelligence, defined or propagated by those grown or involved in traditional computer science programs, and conflating that with general intelligence (Spolsky, McDowell, Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates, and 4 of 5 FAANG founders studied computer science at either some Ivy League university or Stanford).\n\nMaybe when we\u2019re talking about \u201cThe Bar,\u201d we\u2019re really talking about something subjective, based on whoever is doing the measuring, and whose definition might not be consistent from person-to-person.\n\nLooking at candidate assessment behavior from interviewers on the interviewing.io platform, you can find some evidence that supports this hypothesis.\n\n## \u201cThe Bar\u201d is subjective\n\nOn the interviewing.io platform, people can practice technical interviews online and anonymously, with interviewers from top companies on the other side. Interview questions on the platform tend to fall into the category of what you\u2019d encounter at a phone screen for a back-end software engineering role, and interviewers typically come from companies like Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Airbnb, and more. Check out our [interview showcase](https://interviewing.io/mocks) to see how this all looks and to watch people get interviewed. After every interview, interviewers rate interviewees on a few different dimensions: technical skills, communication skills, and problem-solving skills. Each dimension gets rated on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 is \u201cpoor\u201d and 4 is \u201camazing!\u201d. You can see what our feedback form looks like below:\n\n![Screenshot of the Interviewing.io interview feedback form](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5a595_screenshot_2017_11_29_09_13_30_1ca42f5eec.png&w=750&q=75 \"Interviewing.io interview feedback form\")\n\nIf you do well in practice, you can bypass applying online/getting referrals/talking to recruiters and instead immediately book real technical interviews directly with our partner companies (more on that in a moment).\n\nWhen observing our most frequent practice interviewers, we noticed differences across interviewers in the percent of candidates that person would hire, which we call the passthrough rate. Passthrough rates ranged anywhere between 30% and 60%. At first glance, certain interviewers seemed to be a lot stricter than others.\n\n![Chart showing passthrough rates by interviewer](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F08ff4_blog_post_passthrough_rates_by_interviewer_3488f7303d.png&w=1080&q=75 \"Passhrough Rates by Interviewer\")\n\nBecause interviewees and interviewers are anonymized and matched randomly[^1], we wouldn\u2019t expect the quality of candidates to vary much across interviewers, and as a result, wouldn\u2019t expect interviewee quality to explain the difference. Yet even after accounting for candidate attributes like experience level, differences in passthrough rates persist.[^2]\n\nMaybe some interviewers choose to be strict on purpose because their bar for quality is higher. While it\u2019s true that candidates who practiced with stricter interviewers tended to receive lower ratings, they also tended to perform better on their next practice.\n\nThis result could be interpreted in a couple of ways:\n\n- Stricter interviewers might systematically underrate candidates\n- Candidates get so beat up by strict interviewers that they tended to improve more between practices, striving to meet their original interviewer\u2019s higher bar\n\nIf the latter were true, you would expect that candidates who practiced with stricter interviewers would perform better in real company interviews. However, we did not find a correlation between interviewer strictness and future company interview passthrough rate, based on real company interviews conducted on our platform.[^3]\n\n![Chart showing interviewer's passthrough rate vs. interviewee's future performance](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffb594_blog_post_practice_vs_company_passthrough_ea25d930f7.png&w=1080&q=75 \"Interviewer's Passthrough Rate vs. Interviewee's Future Performance\")\n\nInterviewers on our platform represent the kinds of people a candidate would encounter in a real company interview, since those same people also conduct phone screens and onsites at the tech companies you\u2019re all applying to today. And because we don\u2019t dictate how interviewers conduct their interviews, these graphs could be describing the distribution of opinions about your interview performance once you hang up the phone or leave the building.\n\nThis suggests that, independent of your actual performance, **whom you interview with could affect your chance of getting hired**. In other words, \u201cThe Bar\u201d is subjective.\n\nThis variability across interviewers led us to reconsider our own internal definition of \u201cThe Bar,\u201d which determined which candidates were allowed to interview with our partner companies. Our definition strongly resembled Spolsky\u2019s binary criteria (\u201cbe smart\u201d), heavily weighing an interviewer\u2019s Would Hire opinion way more than our other 3 criteria, leading to the bimodal, camel-humped distribution below.\n\n![Chart showing Interviewing.io's Old Internal Score Distribution](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F09df4_blog_post_old_score_distribution_af49004df0.png&w=1080&q=75 \"Interviewing.io's Old Internal Score Distribution\")\n\nWhile our existing scoring system correlated decently with future interview performance, we found that an interviewer\u2019s Would Hire rating wasn\u2019t as strongly associated with future performance as our other criteria were. We lessened the weight on the Would Hire rating, which in turn improved our predictive accuracy.[^4] Just like in *\u201cTalledega Nights\u201d* when [Ricky Bobby learned there existed places other than first place and last place in a race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20iio0wLpPA), we learned that it was more beneficial to think beyond the binary construct of \u201chire\u201d vs. \u201cnot hire,\u201d or if you prefer, \u201csmart\u201d vs. \u201cnot smart.\u201d\n\nOf course, we didn\u2019t get rid of all the subjectivity, since those other criteria were also chosen by the interviewer. And this is what makes assessment hard: an interviewer\u2019s assessment is itself the measure of candidate ability.\n\nIf that measurement isn\u2019t anchored to a standard definition (like we hope general intelligence would be), then the accuracy of any given measurement becomes less certain. It\u2019s as if interviewers used measuring sticks of differing lengths, but all believed their own stick represented the same length, say 1 meter.\n\nWhen we talked to our interviewers to understand how they assessed candidates, it became even more believable that different people might be using measuring sticks of differing lengths. Here are some example methods of how interviewers rated candidates:\n\n- Ask 2 questions. Pass if answer both\n- Ask questions of varying difficulty (easy, medium, hard). Pass if answers a medium\n- Speed of execution matters a lot, pass if answers \u201cfast\u201d (\u201cfast\u201d not clearly defined)\n- Speed doesn\u2019t matter much, pass if have a working solution\n- Candidates start with full points. When candidates make mistakes, start docking points\n\nHaving different assessment criteria isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing (and actually seems totally normal). It just introduces more variance to our measurements, meaning our candidates\u2019 assessments might not be totally accurate.\n\nThe problem is, when people talk about \u201cThe Bar,\u201d that uncertainty around measurement usually gets ignored.\n\nYou\u2019ll commonly see people advising you only to hire the highest quality people.\n\n> *A good rule of thumb is to hire only people who are better than you. Do not compromise. Ever.*\n>\n> \u2013 Laszlo Bock\n\n> *Don\u2019t lower your standards no matter how hard it seems to find those great candidates.*\n>\n> \u2013 Joel Spolsky\n\n> *In the Macintosh Division, we had a saying, \u201cA player hire A players; B players hire C players\u201d\u2013meaning that great people hire great people.*\n>\n> \u2013 Guy Kawasaki\n\n> *Every person hired should be better than 50 percent of those currently in similar roles \u2013 that\u2019s raising the bar.*\n>\n> \u2013 Amazon Bar Raiser blog post\n\nAll of this is good advice, assuming \u201cquality\u201d could be measured reliably, which as we\u2019ve seen so far, isn\u2019t necessarily the case.\n\nEven when uncertainty does get mentioned, that variance gets attributed to the candidate\u2019s ability, rather than the measurement process or the person doing the measuring.\n\n> *[I]n the middle, you have a large number of \u201cmaybes\u201d who seem like they might just be able to contribute something. The trick is telling the difference between the superstars and the maybes, because the secret is that you don\u2019t want to hire any of the maybes. Ever.*\n>\n> \u2026\n>\n> *If you\u2019re having trouble deciding, there\u2019s a very simple solution. NO HIRE. Just don\u2019t hire people that you aren\u2019t sure about.*\n>\n> \u2013 Joel Spolsky\n\nAssessing candidates isn\u2019t a fully deterministic process, yet we talk about it like it is.\n\n## Why **\u201cThe Bar\u201d is so high**\n\n\u201cCompromising on quality\u201d isn\u2019t really about compromise, it\u2019s actually about decision-making in the face of uncertainty. And as you see from the quotes above, the conventional strategy is to only hire when certain.\n\nNo matter what kind of measuring stick you use, this leads to \u201cThe Bar\u201d being set really high. Being really certain about a candidate means minimizing the possibility of making a bad hire (aka \u201cfalse positives\u201d). And companies will do whatever they can to avoid that.\n\n> *A bad candidate will cost a lot of money and effort and waste other people\u2019s time fixing all their bugs. Firing someone you hired by mistake can take months and be nightmarishly difficult, especially if they decide to be litigious about it.*\n>\n> \u2013 Joel Spolsky\n\nHunter and Schmidt quantified the cost of a bad hire: \u201cThe standard deviation\u2026 has been found to be at minimum 40% of the mean salary,\u201d which in today\u2019s terms would translate to $40,000 assuming a mean engineer salary of $100,000/year.\n\nBut if you set \u201cThe Bar\u201d too high, chances are you\u2019ll also miss out on some good candidates (aka \u201cfalse negatives\u201d). McDowell explains why companies don\u2019t really mind a lot of false negatives:\n\n> *\u201cFrom the company\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s actually acceptable that some good candidates are rejected\u2026 They can accept that they miss out on some good people. They\u2019d prefer not to, of course, as it raises their recruiting costs. It is an acceptable tradeoff, though, provided they can still hire enough good people.\u201d*\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s worth holding out for a better candidate if the difference in their expected output is large, relative to the recruiting costs from continued searching. Additionally, the costs of HR or legal issues downstream from potentially problematic employees also tilt the calculation toward keeping \u201cThe Bar\u201d high.\n\nThis is a very rational cost-benefit calculation. But has anyone ever done this calculation before? If you have done it, we\u2019d love to hear from you. Otherwise, it seems difficult to do.\n\nGiven that nearly everyone is using hand-wavy math, if we do the same, maybe we can convince ourselves that \u201cThe Bar\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be set quite so high.\n\nAs mentioned before, the distribution of candidate ability might not be so binary, so Spolsky\u2019s nightmare bad hire scenario wouldn\u2019t necessarily happen with all \u201cbad\u201d hires, meaning the expected difference in output between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d employees might be lower than perceived.\n\nRecruiting costs might be higher than perceived because finding and employing +1 standard deviation employees gets increasingly difficult. By definition, fewer of those people exist as your bar rises. Schmidt and Hunter\u2019s \u201cbad hire\u201d calculation only compares candidates within an applicant pool. The study does not consider the relative cost of getting high-quality candidates into the applicant pool to begin with, which tends to be the more significant concern for many of today\u2019s tech recruiting teams. And when you consider that other tech companies might be employing the same hiring strategy, competition would increase the average probability that offers get rejected, extending the time to fill a job opening.\n\nEstimating the expected cost of HR involvement is also difficult. No one wants to find themselves interacting with HR. But then again, not all HR teams are as useless as [Toby Flenderson](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Toby_Flenderson).\n\nTaken together, if the expected output between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d candidates were less than expected, and the recruiting costs were higher than perceived, it would make less sense to wait for a no-brainer hire, meaning \u201cThe Bar\u201d might not have to be set so high.\n\nEven if one does hire an underperformer, companies could adopt the tools of training and employee management to mitigate the negative effects from some disappointing hires. After all, people can and do become more productive over time as they acquire new skills and knowledge.\n\nEmployee development seems to rarely get mentioned in conjunction with hiring (Laszlo Bock makes a few connections here and there, but the topics are mostly discussed separated). But when you add employee development into the equation above, you start to see the relationship between hiring employees and developing employees. You can think of it as different methods for acquiring more company output from different kinds of people: paying to train existing employees versus paying to recruit new employees.\n\nYou can even think of it as a trade-off. Instead of developing employees in-house, why not outsource that development? Let others figure out how to develop the raw talent, and later pay recruiters to find them when they get good. Why shop the produce aisle at Whole Foods and cook at home when you can just pay Caviar to deliver pad thai to your doorstep? Why spend time managing and mentoring others when you can spend that time doing \u201creal work\u201d (i.e. engineering tasks)?\n\nPerhaps \u201cThe Bar\u201d is set high because companies don\u2019t develop employees effectively, which puts more pressure on the hiring side of the company to yield productive employees.\n\nTherefore, companies can lower their risk by shifting the burden of career development onto the candidates themselves. In response, candidates like Recursive Cactus have little choice but to train themselves.\n\nInitially, I thought Recursive Cactus was a crazy outlier in terms of interview preparation. But apparently, he\u2019s not alone.\n\n## Candidates are training themselves\n\nLast year we surveyed our candidates about how many hours they spent preparing for interviews. Nearly half of the respondents reported spending 100 hours or more on interview preparation.[^5]\n\n![Chart showing responses to the survey question: how many hours spent preparing for interviews](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fb81df_blog_post_survey_hours_65812fae4a.png&w=1080&q=75 \"Survey: Hours Spent Preparing For Interviews\")\n\nWe wondered whether hiring managers and recruiters had the same expectations for candidates they encounter, Aline asked a similar question on Twitter, and results suggest they vastly underestimate the work and effort candidates endure prior to meeting with a company.\n\n> Are you a hiring manager or recruiter? If so, please vote on my poll! Results will be shared in an upcoming, titillating blog post.  \n>   \n> How many dedicated hours of interview prep do you believe candidates should invest in their job search?\n>\n> \u2014 Aline Lerner (@alinelernerLLC) [July 3, 2019](https://twitter.com/alinelernerLLC/status/1146468041212907520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nDecision makers clearly underestimate the amount of work candidates put into job hunt preparation. The discrepancy seems to reinforce the underlying and unstated message pervading all these choices around how we hire: If you\u2019re not one of the smart ones (whatever that means), it\u2019s not our problem. You\u2019re on your own.\n\n## \u201cThe Bar\u201d revisited\n\nSo this is what \u201cThe Bar\u201d is. \u201cThe Bar\u201d is a high standard set by companies in order to avoid false positives. It\u2019s not clear whether companies have actually done the appropriate cost-benefit analysis when setting it, and it\u2019s possible it can be explained by an aversion to investing in employee development.\n\n\u201cThe Bar\u201d is in large part meant to measure your general intelligence, but the actual instruments of measurement don\u2019t necessarily follow the academic literature that underlies it. You can even quibble about the academic literature.[^6] \u201cThe Bar\u201d does measure specific intelligence in computer science, but that measurement might vary depending on who conducts your interview.\n\nDespite the variance that exists across many aspects of the hiring process, we talk about \u201cThe Bar\u201d as if it were deterministic. This allows hiring managers to make clear binary choices but discourages them to think critically about whether their team\u2019s definition of \u201cThe Bar\u201d could be improved.\n\nAnd that helps us understand why Recursive Cactus spends so much time practicing. He\u2019s training himself partially because his current company isn\u2019t developing his skills. He\u2019s preparing for the universe of possible questions and interviewers he might encounter because hiring criteria varies a lot, which cover topics that won\u2019t necessarily be used in his day-to-day work, all so he can resemble someone that\u2019s part of the \u201csmart\u201d crowd.\n\nThat\u2019s the system he\u2019s working within. Because the system is the way it is, it\u2019s had significant impact on his personal life.\n\n> *My wife\u2019s said on more than one occasion that she misses me. I\u2019ve got a rich happy life, but I don\u2019t feel I can be competitive unless I put everything else on hold for months. No single mom can be doing what I\u2019m doing right now.*\n>\n> \u2013 Recursive Cactus\n\nThis impacts his current co-workers too, whom he cares about a lot.\n\n> *This process is sufficiently demanding that I\u2019m no longer operating at 100% at work. I want to do the best job at work, but I don\u2019t feel I can do the right thing for my future by practicing algorithms 4 hours a day *and* do my job well.*\n>\n> *I don\u2019t feel comfortable being bad at my job. I like my teammates. I feel a sense of responsibility. I know I won\u2019t get fired if I mail it in, but I know that it\u2019s them that pick up the slack.*\n>\n> \u2013 Recursive Cactus\n\nIt\u2019s helpful to remember that all the micro decisions made around false positives, interview structure, brain teasers, hiring criteria, and employee development add up to define a system that, at the end of the day, impacts people\u2019s personal lives. Not just the lives of the job hunters themselves, but also all the people that surround them.\n\nHiring is nowhere near a solved problem. Even if we do solve it somehow, it\u2019s not clear we would ever eliminate all that uncertainty. After all, projecting a person\u2019s future work output after spending an hour or two with them in an artificial work setting seems kinda hard. While we should definitely try to minimize uncertainty, it might be helpful to accept it as a natural part of the process.\n\nThis system can be improved. Doing so requires not only coming up with new ideas, but also revisiting decades-old ideas and assumptions, and expanding upon that prior work rather than anchoring ourselves to it.\n\nWe\u2019re confident that all of you people in the tech industry will help make tech hiring better. We know you can do it, because after all, you\u2019re smart.\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

Here\u2019s the data.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: September 7, 2016; Last updated: May 1, 2023\n\n[interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/) is a platform where people can practice technical interviewing anonymously, and if things go well, get jobs at top companies in the process. We started it because [resumes suck](https://blog.alinelerner.com/resumes-suck-heres-the-data/) and because we believe that anyone, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to prove their mettle.\n\nAt the end of 2015, we published a [post about how people are terrible at gauging their own interview performance](https://interviewing.io/blog/people-cant-gauge-their-own-interview-performance-and-that-makes-them-harder-to-hire). At the time, we just had a few hundred interviews to draw on, so as you can imagine, we were quite eager to rerun the numbers with the advent of more data. **After drawing on roughly one thousand interviews, we were surprised to find that the numbers have *really* held up, and that people continue to be terrible at gauging their own interview performance.**\n\n## The setup\n\nWhen an interviewer and an interviewee match on interviewing.io, they meet in a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard and jump right into a technical question (feel free to watch this process in action on our [recordings](https://interviewing.io/mocks) page). After each interview, people leave one another feedback, and each party can see what the other person said about them once they both submit their reviews.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious, you can see what the feedback forms look like below \u2014 in addition to one direct yes/no question, we also ask about a few different aspects of interview performance using a 1-4 scale. We also ask interviewees some extra questions that we don\u2019t share with their interviewers, and one of those questions is about how well they think they did. For context, a technical score of 3 or above seems to be the rough cut-off for hirability.\n\n![Screenshot showing the interviewing.io interview feedback form for interviewers](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F49613_interviewer_feedback_ae7debf69a.webp%3Fupdated_at%3D2022-12-13T17%3A27%3A22.302Z&w=1920&q=75 \"Feedback form for interviewers\")\n\nFeedback form for interviewers\n\n\n\n![Screenshot showing the interviewing.io interview feedback form for interviewees](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F8ddad_interviewee_feedback_3f34ef7a0a.webp%3Fupdated_at%3D2022-12-13T17%3A30%3A40.759Z&w=1920&q=75 \"Feedback form for interviewees\")\n\nFeedback form for interviewees\n\n## Perceived versus actual performance\u2026 revisited\n\nBelow are two heatmaps of perceived vs. actual performance per interview (for interviews where we had both pieces of data). In each heatmap, the darker areas represent higher interview concentration. For instance, the darkest square represents interviews where both perceived and actual performance was rated as a 3. You can hover over each square to see the exact interview count (denoted by \u201cz\u201d).\n\nThe first heatmap is our old data:\n\nAnd the second heatmap is our data as of August 2016:\n\n**As you can see, even with the advent of a lot more interviews, the heatmaps look remarkably similar.** The [R-squared](https://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics/regression-analysis-how-do-i-interpret-r-squared-and-assess-the-goodness-of-fit) for a linear regression on the first data set is 0.24. And for the more recent data set, it\u2019s dropped to 0.18. In both cases, even though some small positive relationship between actual and perceived performance does exist, it is not a strong, predictable correspondence.\n\nYou can also see there\u2019s a non-trivial amount of impostor syndrome going on in the graph above, which probably comes as no surprise to anyone who\u2019s been an engineer. Take a look at the graph below to see what I mean.\n\nThe x-axis is the difference between actual and perceived performance, i.e. actual minus perceived. In other words, a negative value means that you overestimated your performance, and a positive one means that you underestimated it. Therefore, every bar above 0 is impostor syndrome country, and every bar below zero belongs to its foulsome, overconfident cousin, the [Dunning-Kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) effect.[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n\nOn interviewing.io (though I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this finding extrapolated to the qualified engineering population at large), **impostor syndrome plagues interviewees roughly twice as often as Dunning-Kruger**. Which, I guess, is better than the alternative.\n\n## Why people underestimate their performance\n\nWith all this data, I couldn\u2019t resist digging into interviews where interviewees gave themselves 1\u2019s and 2\u2019s but where interviewers gave them 4\u2019s to try to figure out if there were any common threads. And, indeed, a few trends emerged. **The interviews that tended to yield the most interviewee impostor syndrome were ones where question complexity was layered.** In other words, the interviewer would start with a fairly simple question and then, when the interviewee completed it successfully, they would change things up to make it harder. Lather, rinse, repeat. In some cases, an interviewer could get through up to 4 layered tiers in about an hour. Inevitably, even a good interviewee will hit a wall eventually, even if the place where it happens is way further out than the boundary for most people who attempt the same question.\n\n**Another trend I observed had to do with interviewees beating themselves up for issues that mattered a lot to them but fundamentally didn\u2019t matter much to their interviewer**: off-by-one errors, small syntax errors that made it impossible to compile their code (even though everything was semantically correct), getting big-O wrong the first time and then correcting themselves, and so on.\n\n**Interestingly enough, how far off people were in gauging their own performance was independent of how highly rated (overall) their interviewer was or how strict their interviewer was.**\n\nWith that in mind, if I learned anything from watching these interviews, it was this. Interviewing is a flawed, human process. Both sides want to do a good job, but sometimes the things that matter to each side are vastly different. And sometimes the standards that both sides hold themselves to are vastly different as well.\n\n## Why this (still) matters for hiring, and what you can do to make it better\n\nTechniques like layered questions are important to sussing out just how good a potential candidate is and can make for a really engaging positive experience, so removing them isn\u2019t a good solution. And there probably isn\u2019t that much you can do directly to stop an engineer from beating themselves up over a small syntax error (especially if it\u2019s one the interviewer didn\u2019t care about). However, all is not lost!\n\nAs you recall, during the feedback step that happens after each interview, we ask interviewees if they\u2019d want to work with their interviewer. **As it turns out, there\u2019s a very statistically significant relationship between whether people think they did well and whether they\u2019d want to work with the interviewer. This means that when people think they did poorly, they may be a lot less likely to want to work with you**. And by extension, it means that in every interview cycle, some portion of interviewees are losing interest in joining your company just because they didn\u2019t think they did well, *despite the fact that they actually did*.\n\nHow can one mitigate these losses? Give positive, actionable feedback immediately (or as soon as possible)! This way people don\u2019t have time to go through the self-flagellation gauntlet that happens after a perceived poor performance, followed by the inevitable rationalization that they *totally* didn\u2019t want to work there anyway.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. I\u2019m always terrified of misspelling \u201cDunning-Kruger\u201d and not double-checking it because of overconfidence in my own spelling abilities.

This is the third post in our Guest Author series.*\n\n*In this post, our latest Guest Author looks at interviews from the company\u2019s perspective. So much engineering time goes into interviewing\u2026 [we know this firsthand](https://interviewing.io/blog/you-probably-dont-factor-in-engineering-time-when-calculating-cost-per-hire-heres-why-you-really-should), but what can be done about it? Some companies solve this problem by introducing homework. In this post, Alexey digs into some historical data to unearth a really clever, elegant way to save eng time that\u2019s also better for candidate experience!*\n\n*If you have strong opinions about interviewing or hiring that you\u2019ve been itching to write about, we\u2019d love to hear from you. Please email me at [aline@interviewing.io](mailto:aline@interviewing.io) to get started.*\n\n![Author avatar](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff3f50_alexey_scaled_e1606329022499_edef8e39a7.webp&w=384&q=75 \"Alexey Komissarouk\")\n\nAlexey Komissarouk\n\nAlexey Komissarouk is a growth engineering leader. He is currently Head of Growth Engineering at MasterClass. Before that, he spent 2016-2020 at Opendoor, first as an early engineer, then as an Engineering Manager. Between 2013 and 2016, he built out a product engineering consulting company, helping clients such as Dropbox, Pebble, Boomerang, and Binti grow and expand lines of business through a combination of product management and engineering. In his other lives, Alexey co-founded a boutique work+travel company, Hacker Paradise. Since the company\u2019s inception in 2015, they\u2019ve run trips to over a dozen locations and been joined by more than 800 alumni.\n\n\u201cThe new VP wants us to double engineering\u2019s headcount in the next six months. If we have a chance in hell to hit the hiring target, you seriously need to reconsider how fussy you\u2019ve become.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s never good to have a recruiter ask engineers to lower their hiring bar, but he had a point. It can take upwards of [100 engineering hours](https://interviewing.io/blog/you-probably-dont-factor-in-engineering-time-when-calculating-cost-per-hire-heres-why-you-really-should) to hire a single candidate, and we had over 50 engineers to hire. Even with the majority of the team chipping in, engineers would often spend multiple hours a week in interviews. Folks began to complain about interview burnout. Also, fewer people were actually getting offers; the *onsite pass rate* had fallen by almost a third, from ~40% to under 30%. This meant we needed even more interviews for every hire.\n\n[Visnu](https://twitter.com/visnup) and I were early engineers bothered most by the state of our hiring process. We dug in. Within a few months, the **onsite pass rate** went back up, and interviewing burnout receded. **We didn\u2019t lower the hiring bar, though. There was a better way.**\n\n## Introducing: the Phone Screen Team\n\nWe took the company\u2019s best technical interviewers and organized them into a dedicated Phone Screen Team. No longer would engineers be assigned between onsite interviews and preliminary phone screens at recruiting coordinators\u2019 whims. The Phone Screen Team specialized in phone screens; everybody else did onsites.\n\n## Why did you think this would be a good idea?\n\nHonestly, all I wanted at the start was to see if I was a higher-signal interviewer than my buddy Joe. So I graphed people\u2019s phone screen pass rate against how those candidates performed in their onsite pass rate.\n\nJoe turned out to be the better interviewer. More importantly, I stumbled into the fact that a number of engineers doing phone screens performed consistently better across the board. They both had more candidates pass their phone screens and then those candidates would get offers at a higher rate.\n\n![Charts comparing expected vs actual pass rates](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F3e78e_alexeypost1_e6116fd5f4.webp&w=1920&q=75 \"Onsite Pass Rate vs Phone Screen Rate\")\n\nSample data, recreated for illustrative purposes\n\nThese numbers were consistent, quarter over quarter. As we compared the top quartile of phone screeners to everybody else, the difference was stark. Each group included a mix of strict and lenient phone screeners; on average, both groups had a phone screen pass rate of 40%.\n\nThe similarities ended there: the top quartile\u2019s invitees were twice as likely to get an offer after the onsite (50% vs 25%). These results also were consistent across quarters.[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n\nArmed with newfound knowledge of phone screen [superforecasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superforecaster), the obvious move was to have them do all the interviews. In retrospect, [it made a ton of sense](https://medium.com/@alexallain/what-ive-learned-interviewing-500-people-the-interviewer-skills-ladder-for-high-growth-software-37778d2aae85) that some interviewers were \u201cjust better\u201d than others.\n\nA quarter after implementing the new process, the \u201cphone screen to onsite\u201d rate stayed constant, but the \u201consite pass rate\u201d climbed from ~30% to ~40%, shaving more than 10 hours-per-hire [2](#user-content-fn-2). Opendoor was still running this process when I left several years later.\n\nYou should too. [3](#user-content-fn-3) [4](#user-content-fn-4)\n\n## Starting your own Phone Screen Team\n\n### 1. Identifying interviewers\n\nGet your Lever or Greenhouse (or [ATS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system) of choice) into an analyzable place somewhere, and then quantify how well interviewers perform.[5](#user-content-fn-5) There\u2019s lots of ways to analyze performance; here\u2019s a simple approach which favors folks who generated lots of offers from as few as possible onsites and phone screens.\n\n![Phone screener quality equation](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc21cb_screen_shot_2020_11_25_at_10_52_57_am_539a0e3740.webp&w=1920&q=75 \"Phone screener quality\")\n\nYou can adjust the constants to where zero would match a median interviewer. A score of zero, then, is good. Your query will look something like this:\n\n| **Interviewer** | **Phone Screens** | **Onsites** | **Offers** | **Score** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Accurate Alice | 20 | 5 | 3 | (45 \u2013 20 \u2013 20) / 20 = 0.25 |\n| Friendly Fred | 20 | 9 | 4 | (60 \u2013 36 \u2013 20) / 20 = 0.2 |\n| Strict Sally | 20 | 4 | 2 | (30 \u2013 16 \u2013 20) / 20 = -0.3 |\n| Chaotic Chris | 20 | 10 | 3 | (45 \u2013 40 \u2013 20) / 20 = -0.75 |\n| No Good Nick | 20 | 12 | 2 | (30 \u2013 48 \u2013 20) / 30 = -1.9 |\n\nIdeally, hires would also be included in the funnel, since a great phone screen experience would make a candidate more likely to join. I tried including them; unfortunately, the numbers get too small and we start running out of statistical predictive power.\n\n### 2. Logistics & Scheduling\n\nPhone Screen interviewers no longer do onsite interviews (except as emergency backfills). The questions they ask are now retired from the onsite interview pool to avoid collisions.\n\nAsk the engineers to identify and block off 4 hour-long weekly slots to make available to recruiting (recruiting coordinators will love you). Use a tool like [youcanbook.me](https://youcanbook.me/) or [calendly](https://calendly.com/) to create a unified availability calendar. Aim to have no more than ~2.5 interviews per interviewer per week. To minimize burnout, one thing we tried was to take 2 weeks off interviewing every 6 weeks.\n\nTo avoid conflict, ensure that interviewers\u2019 managers are bought in to the time commitment and incorporate their participation during performance reviews.\n\n### 3. Onboarding Interviewers\n\nWhen new engineers join the company and start interviewing, they will initially conduct on-site interviews only. If they perform well, consider inviting them into the phone screen team as slots open up. Encourage new members to keep the same question they were already calibrated on, but adapt it to the phone format as needed. In general, it helps to [make the question easier and shorter](https://triplebyte.com/blog/how-to-interview-engineers) than if you were conducting the interview in person.\n\nWhen onboarding a new engineer onto the team, have them shadow a current member twice, then be reverse-shadowed by that member twice. Discuss and offer feedback after each shadowing.\n\n### 4. Continuous Improvement\n\nInterviewing can get repetitive and lonely. Fight this head-on by having recruiting coordinators add a second interviewer (not necessarily from the team) to join 10% or so of interviews and discuss afterwards.\n\nHold a monthly retrospective with the team and recruiting, with three items on the agenda:\n\n- discuss potential process improvements to the interviewing process\n- review borderline interviews with the group to review together, if [your interviewing tool](https://coderpad.io) supports recording and playback\n- have interviewers read through feedback their candidates got from onsite interviewers and look for consistent patterns\n\n### 5. Retention\n\nEventually, interviewers may get burnt out and say things like \u201cI\u2019m interviewing way more people than others on my actual team \u2013 why? I could just go do onsite interviews.\u201d This probably means it\u2019s time to rotate them out. Six months feels about right for a typical \u201cphone screen team\u201d tour of duty, to give people a rest. Some folks may not mind and stay on the team for longer.\n\nBuy exclusive swag for team members. Swag are cheap and these people are doing incredibly valuable work. Leaderboards (\u201cSarah interviewed 10 of the new hires this year\u201d) help raise awareness. Appreciation goes a long way.\n\nAlso, people want to be on teams with cool names. Come up with a cooler name than \u201cPhone Screen Team.\u201d My best idea so far is \u201cAmbassadors.\u201d\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere\u2019s something very Dunder Mifflin about companies that create Growth Engineering organizations to micro-optimize conversion, only to have those very growth engineers struggle to focus due to interview thrash from an inefficient hiring process. These companies invest millions into hiring, coaching and retaining the very best sales people. Then they leave recruiting \u2013 selling the idea of working at the company \u2013 in the hands of an engineer that hasn\u2019t gotten a lick of feedback on their interviewing since joining two years ago, with a tight project deadline on the back of her mind.\n\nIf you accept the simple truth that not all interviewers are created equal, that the same rigorous quantitative process with which you improve the business should also be used to improve your internal operations, and if you\u2019re trying to hire quickly, you should consider creating a Technical Phone Screen Team.\n\n## FAQs, Caveats, and Preemptive Defensiveness\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. **Was this statistically significant, or are you conducting pseudoscience?** Definitely pseudoscience. Folks in the sample were conducting about 10 interviews a month, ~25 per quarter. Perhaps not yet ready to [publish in Nature](https://idp.nature.com/authorize?response_type=cookie&client_id=grover&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-019-00857-9) but meaningful enough to infer from, especially considering the relatively low cost of being wrong. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n2. **Why didn\u2019t the on-site pass rate double, as predicted?** First, not all of the top folks ended up joining the team. Second, the best performers did well because of a combination of skill (great interviewers, friendly, high signal) and luck (got better candidates). Luck is fleeting, resulting in a [regression to the mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean). [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-2)\n3. **What size does this start to make sense at**? Early on, you should just identify who you believe your [best interviewers](https://interviewing.io/blog/our-business-depends-on-having-the-best-interviewers-so-we-built-an-interviewer-rating-system-and-you-can-too) are and have them (or yourself) do all the phone screens. Then, once you start hiring rapidly enough that you are doing about 5-10 phone screens a week, run the numbers and invite your best 2-3 onsite interviewers to join and create the team. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-3)\n4. **What did you do for specialized engineering roles?** They had their own dedicated processes. Data Science ran a take home, Front-End engineers had their own Phone Screen sub-team, and Data and ML Engineers went through the general full-stack engineer phone screen. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-4)\n5. **Didn\u2019t shrinking your Phone Screener pool hurt your diversity?** In fact, the opposite happened. First, the phone screener pool had a higher percentage of women than the engineering organization at the time; second, a common interviewing anti-pattern is \u201chazing\u201d \u2013 asking difficult questions and then rejecting somebody for \u201cnot even remembering about Kahn\u2019s algorithm, lolz.\u201d The best phone screeners don\u2019t haze, bringing a more diverse group onsite.

This round of funding is a long time coming. I don\u2019t know what the average company age is when successfully raising an A, but it took us 6 years to get here. It was a long and windy path, and for a little while, we almost died (more on that below), but we\u2019re still here, and we\u2019re so grateful and excited to finally have the resources to do what we\u2019ve always wanted to do: fix hiring, for real.\n\nWhat does \u201cfixing hiring\u201d mean? We believe that the only way to really effect change, is to make hiring more efficient\u2014meaning that the right people are talking to the right companies at the right time. *Make hiring efficient* is actually our company mission. \u201cEfficient? But, that\u2019s so uninspiring,\u201d one might say. And to that, we say false. For us, fairness follows from efficiency\u2026 whereas the reverse isn\u2019t necessarily true.\n\nHow do you make hiring efficient? Here\u2019s our todo list:\n\n1. Kill resumes\n2. Democratize access to interview practice: make it so everyone who needs practice can get it and can enter the technical interview process on a level playing field\n3. Democratize access to jobs and put power back in the hands of individual engineers. Make it so people who are good, regardless of who they are or how they look on paper, can talk directly to hiring managers at any company they want, whenever they want\n\n## Killing resumes\n\nMany years ago, when I was working as a recruiter, I wrote a program that took hundreds of candidate resumes who had previously interviewed at the company, and looked at a bunch of different traits, including GPA, years of experience, university, highest degree earned, previous employer, and so on.\n\nI found that, by far and away, the thing that mattered most was [how many typos and grammatical errors a resume ha](https://blog.alinelerner.com/lessons-from-a-years-worth-of-hiring-data/)d. Where people went to school didn\u2019t matter at all, and neither did any of the other traits above (except their previous employer, which mattered a bit, but much less than the typos).\n\nI also did an experiment where I showed anonymized resumes to recruiters and hiring managers, asking them if they\u2019d interview that candidate. Not only could they not tell who the good candidates were, they all [disagreed with each other about what a good candidate looked like](https://blog.alinelerner.com/resumes-suck-heres-the-data/) in the first place.\n\nIt became abundantly clear to me that resumes sucked, but if we\u2019re honest, they\u2019re not the only problem. Once you\u2019re in the door, you have to pass the technical interview.\n\n## Democratizing access to interview practice\n\nTechnical interviews are hard for all engineers, regardless of background or seniority, but they\u2019re not going away for a while, and, perhaps worst of all, access to practice isn\u2019t equitably distributed. At schools like MIT, where I went for undergrad, students have boundless access to interview practice. When I was there, not only was there a multi-week course during the month-long break between Fall and Spring semesters that was dedicated exclusively to passing technical interviews, but there was a social component to it as well \u2014everyone at these schools is interviewing at FAANG for internships and new grad positions, which means that students can practice with each other, share their successes and failures, and, over time, internalize just how much of technical interviewing is a numbers game. Once you \u201cget it\u201d, you know that bombing a Google interview doesn\u2019t mean that you weren\u2019t meant to be an engineer. It just means that you need to work some more problems, do more mock interviews, and try again at Facebook.\n\nStudents not coming from these schools, or any engineers without an existing network of people with whom they could practice, would miss out not only on the interview prep, but also on the more subtle change in perception where failure is a temporary state, not a death sentence.\n\nAnd so, interviewing.io was born. The idea was simple. Any software engineer could use the platform to prepare for technical interviewing via *anonymous* mock interviews with senior engineers from top companies like Google, Facebook and others. Junior engineers could get a taste of what real interviews were like and grok that these interviews are a learned skill. Senior engineers could de-rust and warm back up without anyone knowing who they were.\n\nInterviews suck for everyone. **Many engineers, regardless of seniority or pedigree, perform poorly in their first mock interview, but after about 5 practice interviews, their odds of passing a real interview double.** **In fact, after getting the requisite amount of practice interviews in and warming up, there is NO difference in interview performance among engineers who graduated from a top-tier CS school and those who did not.**\n\n## Democratizing access to jobs and putting engineers in the driver\u2019s seat of their job search\n\nIf you do well in practice interviews, no matter who you are or how you look on paper, you unlock our jobs portal. With 2 clicks, you can book real interviews with engineers at top companies, bypassing online applications, resume screens, and recruiters.\n\nIn other words, you don\u2019t have to have a friend refer you in or wait for recruiters to contact you and then spend weeks scheduling calls. You\u2019re in control, and you can book or not book whenever you like.\n\nThese interviews are also anonymous, just like practice, which means that companies don\u2019t know who you are until *after* the interview, so you\u2019re judged on what you can do, not how you look on paper.\n\nFor employers who hire through us, this is a win. End-to-end, from first touch to hire, a top-tier tech company will hire about 0.5% of its candidates. With interviewing.io, that number is closer to 10%, and companies who use it save an average of 220 hours per hire, split between engineering and recruiting. **Close to half of our hires are candidates the company would not have considered if they had seen just their resume, and many of these engineers had previously been rejected by literally the same company where they later got hired via interviewing.io.** Over our lifetime, we\u2019ve made hires for companies like Facebook, Amazon, Lyft, Uber, Snap, Dropbox, and dozens of others.\n\n**The other, subtle value-add is that while, to the rest of the world, interviewing.io users look like passive candidates who aren\u2019t on the market \u2014 they don\u2019t update their LinkedIn or start blogging or tweeting \u2014 interviewing.io knows they\u2019re about to look because they\u2019ve started practicing. In other words, we know the 2 things that actually matter: who\u2019s good and who\u2019s actually looking right now. No one else, not even LinkedIn, has that information.**\n\nAnd for those engineers, we roll out the red carpet.\n\n## A brief interlude: The bit where we almost died but then didn\u2019t\n\nThis all sounds pretty good, right? It kind of was, but then things got bad. You see, for most of our existence, we made all of our money from employers, which meant that we could offer interview practice for free. When hiring ground to a halt in the wake of COVID, we lost almost all of our revenue and started charging individual engineers for interview practice to survive. You can see the [blog post where we announced our pivot](https://interviewing.io/blog/interviewing-io-is-out-of-beta-anonymous-technical-interview-practice-for-all), and while the post\u2019s title is kind of peppy, it was a very hard post to write and an even harder decision to make. If you want to hear the whole sordid tale of woe, you can listen to my 2020 interview on Indie Hackers:\n\nAfter we made the switch, we promised our users that we would find a way to make it so people who couldn\u2019t afford to pay us could still practice on our platform\u2014if we didn\u2019t do that, we\u2019d be in gross violation of our goal to democratize access to practice. That promise is a large part of why we raised this round. More on that in a moment.\n\nHere\u2019s the shape of our revenue before and after COVID (things started to go south a few months before quarantine\u2026 there\u2019s always a seasonal dip in our business, but this time it never recovered).\n\n![It looks cool now, but it wasn\u2019t fun to live through.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Screen_Shot_2021_10_17_at_2_25_22_PM_bebee560fb.webp)\n\nIt looks cool now, but it wasn\u2019t fun to live through.\n\nThe hockey-stick growth we had after our switch is what enabled us to raise this A. And that hockey-stick growth is due to the herculean efforts of the interviewing.io team to build out and test a brand new product in a little over a month, while the future loomed more and more uncertain. A special thank you here to the longest-standing members of the team who were here before COVID and through it: Liz Graves, Sam Jordan, Eamonn MacConville, and Dawid Kluszczynski.\n\n![This is our awesome team. Thanks guys.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/team_photo_2021_final_46a24a9101.webp)\n\nThis is our awesome team. Thanks guys.\n\nIt\u2019s due to our intrepid interviewer community, who stuck by us and continued to give hours of their time to helping people practice and get better, even when they were unsure if we\u2019d be around tomorrow.\n\nIt\u2019s due to the short list customers who stayed on even when hiring slowed down, those who came back when the economy started to recover, and the new ones who\u2019ve taken a bet on us since.\n\nAnd it\u2019s due to our users who could have rightfully rage quit when we started charging them for something that used to be free\u2026 but instead chose to stay, answered our myriad user research emails about pricing and offerings, and were willing not only to to pay us, but pay us through a series of rather suspicious-looking PayPal links (before we actually integrated payments into our platform).\n\nToday, an engineer signs up for interviewing.io every 8 minutes, we have over a third of Bay Area engineers in our ecosystem, and **over our lifetime, interviewing.io has hosted close to 100K technical interviews. In the process, we\u2019ve observed, over and over, that where someone went to school has no bearing on how they\u2019ll perform in an interview.**\n\n## Why M13 (including the bit where I was pitching while 7 months pregnant)?\n\nWe chose M13 to lead our Series A because both Brent Murri and Matt Hoffman immediately understood our vision for what good hiring looks like and both cared deeply about fixing it for engineers in particular. Perhaps most importantly, they not only understood, but encouraged me to invest time and resources in the power of our community. Our one core value as a company is to put candidate (read: engineer) experience first, regardless of where the money is coming from. We want to be the place where smart people hang out and come back to. If we have that right, everything else will come. Building for engineers, smart driven creative engineers, is a bit of a double-edged sword (because they, too, are brashly opinionated), but it\u2019s also a gift. Not everyone gets to love their users, and most companies don\u2019t get to tangibly change people\u2019s lives and give people stuff they can\u2019t get anywhere else. We\u2019re able to do that, and we\u2019re fortunate to have found partners who believe in this value as fervently as we do.\n\nAnd, look, I have no idea if this is the right place to put this, but there\u2019s one other reason we went with M13. Most people don\u2019t know this (though I guess they will now), but I started pitching our Series A when I was 7 months pregnant. I had been hoping to start earlier, but there was a lot of deck work and pitch practice that preceded it, and I\u2019m a solo founder, so all the pitch practice and deck work had to be slotted in between continuing to run the company. (As an aside, my team is awesome. I didn\u2019t realize exactly how awesome until I had to give birth 3 weeks early and ended up being on unplanned leave for several weeks afterwards with no plans in place yet\u2026 in retrospect, I could have stepped back and focused on pitching much earlier!)\n\nSo there I am, on a bunch of Zoom calls with investors, where they see me from the neck up, while fielding all manners of conflicting advice about when to reveal that I\u2019m in the family way. Of course, in an ideal world, you reveal it immediately, and it doesn\u2019t change anything. And there are those who would advise leading with the pregnancy because if investors aren\u2019t immediately supportive, fuck them, right? After hearing all sorts of horror stories, I took the middle road and decided to wait until prospective investors had at least a few meetings with me and had the chance to get what interviewing.io was before dropping the news. Not only were the folks at M13 completely gracious about the big reveal, but the way they handled the rest of the process was exemplary, even when I went dark at the most fraught part of the deal\u2014right after I got their term sheet\u2014because, well, I went into the hospital for a routine checkup in between investor calls and came out with a baby. (Don\u2019t worry, everything worked out alright, and we have a beautiful baby girl.)\n\nI hope every founder who\u2019s pregnant or about to be or has small children has the kind of experience that I had with M13. Full stop. In that world, worrying about when to break the news that we\u2019re pregnant will be an unfortunate, anachronistic blip.\n\n## What\u2019s next? (Spoiler: We\u2019re going to make it so anyone can practice now and pay later, and we\u2019ll get *all* the companies you want onto our platform)\n\nNow that we have the resources, we want to make good on the promises we made to our users back when things got real hard. It\u2019s not possible to democratize access to interview prep if you\u2019re charging for it, so that we\u2019d create a Fellowship program where engineers from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds can practice for free and that we\u2019d create a program where people who needed practice now could defer payment until they got a job.\n\nWe\u2019ve already rolled out the first two things (and will be running a 3rd Fellowship cohort soon). Our deferred payment program has been in pilot mode for the last few months, and so far we\u2019ve seen an amazing 94% payback rate. **With our Series A funding, we\u2019ll be able to take this program out of pilot mode and roll it out to every engineer on our platform\u2014 don\u2019t pay us a dime until you get a job and are in a position to pay.**\n\nThe other big thing we\u2019re going to focus on is getting more employers on interviewing.io. Hiring is back, post-COVID, in a big way, and as we regrow the employer side of our business, we\u2019ll be able to make our platform more affordable, even without deferred payments. We also want to fulfill our promise of putting power back in the hands of engineers. Hiring is bad. Resumes don\u2019t tell you much, scheduling is painful, getting in front of companies takes weeks of emailing if you\u2019re lucky and infinite time if you\u2019re not. We\u2019re rethinking hiring from the ground up, automating away the cruft, and removing friction for the part that matters: *smart people talking to each other about the actual work.* **So, if you\u2019re a top performer on our platform, no matter who you are, our goal is to make it so you can speak to a hiring manager at any company you want, anonymously, as early as the next day, and get fast-tracked through the rest of the process.**\n\n*This post wouldn\u2019t be complete without a thank you to all of the new investors who joined in this round in addition to M13. A special thank you to our existing investors, many of whom invested in multiple rounds. Of those, I\u2019d like to mention the following people individually: Leo Polovets at Susa Ventures, Freada Kapor Klein at Kapor Capital (who\u2019s been with us since the very, very beginning\u2026 thank you)*, *David Waxman at TenOneTen Ventures, and Peter Livingston at Unpopular Ventures. Even when things got really bad and we were sitting at the very nadir in the graph above, they were with us every step of the way and continued to believe in our vision for better hiring.*\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

Below are some of my most salient thoughts on the subject. Note that I\u2019ll be talking a lot about engineering hiring because that\u2019s what I know, but I expect a lot of this applies to other fields as well, especially ones where the demand for labor outstrips supply.\n\n## Don\u2019t get caught up by flashy employment history; hustle trumps brands\n\nAt first glance, hiring someone who\u2019s done recruiting for highly successful tech giants seems like a no-brainer. Google and Facebook are good at hiring great engineers, right? So why not bring in someone who\u2019s had a hand in that success?\n\nThere are a couple of reasons why hiring straight out of the Googles and Facebooks of the world isn\u2019t necessarily the best idea. First off, if you look at a typical recruiter\u2019s employment history, you\u2019re going to see a lot of short stints. Very likely this means that they were working as a contractor. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with contract recruiting, per se, large companies often hire contract recruiters in batches, convert the best performers to full-time hires, and ditch the rest.[1](#user-content-fn-1) That said, some of the best recruiters I know started out at Google. But I am inclined to believe they are exceptions.\n\nThe second and much more important reason not to blindly hire out of tech giants is the importance of scrappiness and hustle in this hire. **If you work as a recruiter at Google, you\u2019re basically plugged into the matrix. You have a readymade suite of tools that make it much easier to be successful. You have a database of candidates who have previously interviewed that spans a huge portion of the engineering population. Email discovery is easier. Reaching out to people is easier because you have templates that have been proven to work to rely on. And you can lean on the Google brand as a crutch.** Who hasn\u2019t been, at one point in their career, flattered by an email from a Google recruiter? As a result, if you\u2019re sending these emails, you don\u2019t have to go out of your way to write personal messages or to convince people that your company is cool and interesting and worth their time. You get that trust for free.\n\nContrast this setup with being *the very first person* in the recruiting org. You have no tools. You have no templates. You probably have no brand. You probably have, well, jack shit. You need someone who\u2019s going to think critically about tooling and balance the need for tooling with a shoestring budget, especially in a space where most tooling has a price tag of at least $1K per month. You\u2019re going to need someone whose methods are right for your particular situation rather than someone who does things because that\u2019s just how they\u2019ve always been done. You probably want someone who realizes that paying for a LinkedIn Recruiter seat is a huge fucking waste of money and that sourcing on LinkedIn, in general, is a black hole-level time suck. You want someone who is good at engaging with candidates independently of brand sparkle, which likely means someone who understands the value of personalization in their sourcing efforts. You want someone who compensates for your relatively unknown status with great candidate experience during your interview process. You want someone who won\u2019t just blindly pay tens of thousands of dollars for career fair real estate because that\u2019s just what you do, even though the only companies who get ROI on career fair attendance are ones with preexisting brands. And, apropos, you want someone who can start building a sparkly brand for you from day one because building a brand takes time. (More on brand-building in the last two sections on marketing chops and evangelism.)\n\n## Sales chops are hugely important, and you can test for those\n\nPeople often ask me if having an engineering background is important for technical recruiters. My answer to that is always, \u201cYes, but.\u201d Yes, it\u2019s useful, but the main reason it\u2019s useful is that it helps build credibility and rapport with candidates. A good salesperson can do that without all the trappings of engineering experience. **To put it another way, at the end of the day, this is a sales job. Great engineers who are shitty salespeople will not do well at recruiting. Great salespeople with no engineering background will likely do well.**\n\nSo, how can you test for sales aptitude? If the candidate is currently an in-house recruiter somewhere, I ask them to pitch me on the company\u2019s product. If they\u2019re an agency recruiter, I ask them to pitch me on one of their clients\u2019 products. Most recruiters do a decent job of pitching the company as a good place to work, but unfortunately, many don\u2019t have a very good understanding of what their company actually does. Given that they\u2019re the first point of contact for candidates, it\u2019s really important to be able to answer basic questions about product-market fit, challenges (both product and engineering), how the company makes money, how much traction there is, what the competition looks like, and so on. Moreover, a lack of interest in something this basic points to a lack of intellectual curiosity in general, and in a technical recruiter, this is a very poor sign because such a huge portion of the job is picking up new concepts and being able to talk about them intelligently to very smart people.\n\n## You want someone who can write\n\nI was on the fence about whether to include this section because it sounds kind of obvious, but writing well is important in this role for two reasons. **First off, your recruiter is likely going to be the first point of contact with candidates. And if you\u2019re an early-ish company without much brand, correspondence with the recruiter will likely be the first time a candidate ever hears of you.** So, you probably want that interaction to shine. And the other reason you want someone who cares about narrative, spelling, and grammar is that they will be the arbiter of these abilities in future recruiting hires. Enough said.\n\nOne exercise I like to have candidates for this role go through is writing mock sourcing emails to people at your company, as if they were still at their previous position. This portion of the interview process is probably the best lens into what it\u2019s actually like to work with the candidate. In particular, because candidates are not likely to have a clear idea of what they\u2019re pitching yet, I try to make this part of the process iterative and emphasize that I welcome any number of questions about anything, whether it\u2019s the company\u2019s offering, what companies my firm works with, what certain parts of the engineers\u2019 profiles mean, or anything in between. What questions people ask, how they ask them, and how they deal with the ambiguity inherent in this assignment is part of the evaluation, as is the caliber of the research they did on each mock email recipient.\n\n## You want someone with marketing chops\n\nI talked a bit earlier about how you probably have no brand to speak of at this point. I can\u2019t stress enough how much easier having a brand makes hiring. Until you have one, especially in this climate, you\u2019re going to be fighting so fucking hard for every one-off hire. If you can, you ought to put effort into branding such that you end up in the enviable position of smart people coming to you.\n\nSo why don\u2019t early-ish companies do this across the board? **Brand building is a pain in the ass, it takes time, and not all of your outbound efforts are going to be measurable, which can make it harder to get others in your org to buy in.** If you can find someone who\u2019s had even a little bit of marketing experience, they\u2019ll be able to identify channels to get the word out, use their preexisting network to help with outsource-able tasks, and get the ball rolling on things like hosting events, which, if you\u2019ve never done before, can be quite intimidating.\n\nAnd because recruiting doesn\u2019t live in a vacuum and needs help from other teams to send something high-signal and genuine into the world, someone with some marketing experience will likely have an easier time getting other teams to buy in and put time and resources into this endeavor, which brings me to my next point.\n\n## You want someone who can fearlessly evangelize the importance of recruiting\u2026 and get you to take an active role even when you don\u2019t feel like it\n\nThe harsh reality is that the primary reason companies hire their first recruiter is so that hiring can be taken off the plate of the founders. It\u2019s tempting to have the \u201cset it and forget it\u201d mentality in a founder\u2019s shoes \u2014 recruiters aren\u2019t cheap, so presumably if you pay them enough, they\u2019ll just deal with this pesky hiring thing, and then you can get back to work. I get it. Hiring isn\u2019t that fun, and as a founder, despite having been a recruiter myself, there are definitely days when I just want to pay someone to, for the love of god, take this bullshit off my hands so I can get back to talking to users and selling and figuring out what to build next and all sorts of other things.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t work that way. If you\u2019re a founder, no one can sell your vision as well as you. And all that experience you\u2019ve built up that makes you a subject matter expert probably also makes you pretty good at filtering candidates. You might take a lot of what\u2019s in your head for granted, but transferring that over into someone else\u2019s brain is going to take time and iteration. And you can never really dissociate from hiring entirely because the moment you do, the culture of \u201chiring is just the domain of recruiting\u201d is going to trickle down into your culture, and over time, it will cost you the best people.\n\nIn my recruiting days, at a high level, I saw two types of hiring cultures. One had the hiring managers and teams taking an active role, participating in sourcing, tweaking interview questions to make them engaging and reflective of the work, and taking time to hang out with candidates, even if they weren\u2019t interviewing yet. The other type had the recruiting org be largely disjoint from the teams it was hiring for. In this type of setup, team members would view recruiting as a hassle/necessary evil that took them away from their regular job, and most of the remaining trappings of the hiring process would be left in the hands of recruiters alone.\n\n**You can guess which type of company ends up with an enviable interview process, a sweet blog, cool, hiring-themed easter eggs in their code, and a wistful, pervading, nose-pressed-against-the-glass refrain of \u201cI wish I could work there\u201d. And you can, in turn, guess which company demands a CS degree and 10 years of [insert recent language name here] experience in their job descriptions.**\n\nDespite these realities, founders and hiring managers often forget how critical their role in hiring is because they have a ton of everyday tasks on their plates. This is why having your recruiter be a fearless evangelist is so important. This person needs to cheerfully yet insistently remind the team and especially founders (who are, after all, the ones who dictate culture) that time spent on hiring is part of their jobs. This person needs to be able to march into the CEO\u2019s office and demand that they go and give a talk somewhere or consistently block off time on their calendar every week to send some sourcing emails. Or that they need to write some stuff somewhere on the internet such that people start to realize that their company is a thing. Marching into a CEO\u2019s office and making demands is tough. You need a person who will do this without trepidation and who will be able to convince you, even when the sky is falling, that a few hours a week spent on hiring are a good use of your time.\n\nIn addition to these points, all the usual thought points about hiring someone who\u2019s going to be growing a team apply here. Is this person already a strong leader? If not, can they grow into one? Are they going to be able to attract other talent to their team? Are they someone you want around, fighting alongside you in the dark, for a long time to come? And, though in an ideal world I\u2019d choose someone with experience who also meets the criteria I\u2019ve outlined in this guide, if ultimately faced with a choice between experience and someone green with hustle, charisma, writing ability, and smarts, I\u2019ll choose the latter every time.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. As an aside, this process is an unfortunate side effect of employment law meant to protect contractors from being exploited. The thinking is that by capping the length of time that someone can work as a contractor, you can exert pressure on the company to turn them into full-time hires who have to be given benefits. But as with many well-intentioned, regulatory pieces of legislation, that\u2019s not really what happens in practice. The practical takeaway, though, is that if someone is great at recruiting, they\u2019re probably not going to have a bunch of short contracting stints.

It\u2019s about something that\u2019s a little bit nuts: a non-engineer passed a Google system design interview! What??! Surely something is misrepresented here, and surely something is overblown.*\n\n*Here are the facts and some key context:*\n\n- *interviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform.*\n- *We have hundreds of interviewers who are (or have recently been) senior, staff, and principal engineers at FAANG.*\n- *We pay these interviewers to conduct anonymous mock interviews in the styles of their companies, and we instruct them to use at least the same bar that they would use in real life.*\n- *We instruct our interviewers to never use proprietary questions or do anything that would jeopardize their NDAs with these companies.*\n- *The Google interview in this post is a mock interview in the style of Google, conducted by a current or former Googler on our platform (we won\u2019t say anything more about the interviewer to protect their identity, and we\u2019ve also changed their voice). The interviewer didn\u2019t have any context and thought this was a regular mock interview, and we stand behind its realism.*\n- *To corroborate the results, we had a few independent Google interviewers evaluate the interview replay without knowing the context. Most interviewers said the question was realistic. One said that the question was too hard for an L4 candidate. Several said that the interviewer was too lenient, and one said that the candidate squeaked by in part because he made the interviewer believe he was already in process for an L5 role. One said the feedback was on point. We didn\u2019t get consensus\u2026 but that somewhat tracks real life, where interviews are messy and outcomes are not deterministic.*\n- *Even if the interviewer was a bit lenient, the fact that a non-engineer could pass or get close to passing a system design interview is nuts. It\u2019s a testament to how teachable this material is, and it\u2019s also a commentary on how these interviews are flawed and can be gamed, with enough effort. We are acutely aware of the shortcomings of the status quo and want to see a revolution in our industry as much as you do.*\n\n*At the bottom of this post, you can watch the full interview and judge for yourself.*\n\nMy name is Kevin. I am not and have never been a software engineer. I have never written or tested a single line of code, and I have never even worked as a PM. My tech career started in (don\u2019t hate me!) recruiting. Then moved into career coaching and salary negotiation before I got where I am now: creating content for engineers.\n\nWith a fraction of the domain knowledge most engineers have, I passed a Google system design interview. I passed because I learned a LOT about system design interviews before taking this interview. I also learned a few tricks along the way. **If these tricks helped *me* pass, then imagine what you\u2019ll be able to do with them**.\n\n## How a non-coder learned a LOT about system design interviews\n\nAt interviewing.io, part of my job is talking to candidates about the interview process. Many complain about system design interviews. They don\u2019t know how to approach them or how to handle the ambiguity. Here\u2019s what one of our users had to say:\n\n> *System design interviews are very intimidating. The de facto assumption is that if you have worked for 5+ years, you should have excellent scalable systems experience and if you fail to show that at interviews, you're penalized either by not getting the offer or by getting down leveled significantly. The analogy I can think of is like asking an elephant to fly when the job description is to lift and move heavy things.*\n\nAt the time, the most popular system design resources were eerily similar. None of them had good solutions for approaching, handling ambiguity in, or demystifying system design interviews. So, we decided to try to make the best system design guide in the world, and I got to lead the project.\n\nFirst, I talked to some of our highest-rated system design interviewers. Then, we started work on the guide. My role was to facilitate, listen, project manage, write, edit, and repeat.\n\nAfter months of work, we published [A Senior Engineer\u2019s Guide to the System Design Interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) on March 2nd, 2023. [It did well on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34999464). If you Google \u201csystem design interview\u201d, it\u2019s the #1 result (as of when this post was published).\n\n## Why I decided to try doing a system design interview myself\n\nAfter the guide was released, I met again with some of the contributors. Out of nowhere, one said, \u201cI bet you could pass a system design interview.\u201d The other two agreed. I accepted the challenge and decided I wouldn\u2019t study; I\u2019d just use what I learned from making the guide.\n\nI scheduled a mock system design interview with an interviewer from Google on interviewing.io for a Friday morning. My interviewer wouldn\u2019t know who I was and would only know my years of experience (I said I had 4). The only other thing my interviewer would know about me was that I presumably was about to interview at Google and needed help preparing.\n\n![How to book Google system design interviews on interviewing.io](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sd_g_67800b6ebb.png)\n\nHow to book Google system design interviews on interviewing.io\n\n## Selected highlights from my system design interview\n\nI\u2019ll walk you through a few clips from the interview that cover three key aspects of my experience: an unconventional idea, something I failed spectacularly at, and a moment I\u2019m proud of.\n\n### An unconventional idea\n\nLast year, I went to Harvard Law School\u2019s Advanced Negotiation Workshop. They spend a lot of time (33% of the whole workshop!) drilling into the specifics of how negotiations are often won or lost in the first and last 3 minutes. I approached the first 180 seconds of this system design interview with that in mind, and I knew I had to quickly score some social proof with the interviewer.\n\n[The unwritten codes of FAANG interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process) taught me one unobvious way to score social proof. Win the competition about who cares less. **I\u2019m naturally enthusiastic so I had to trick myself. To find that devil-may-care attitude, I\u2019d repeat a lyric from Green Day in my head: *\u201cI don\u2019t care that you don\u2019t care.\u201d***\n\nIn this clip, I try to score some points in the first 180 seconds of the interview. Note that we swapped out both my voice and the interviewer\u2019s voice, so it sounds a bit robotic, but the content is preserved.\n\n### Something I failed spectacularly at\n\nSimply put, I forgot you could cache data on a user\u2019s device. More importantly, they grilled me about caching and I took it personally. I lost sight of the interview. Caught in a story of them as an adversary, I stopped listening. I ignored their follow-up questions and, ironically, their hints.\n\nAs Marcellus Wallace said in Pulp Fiction, \"Pride only hurts.\" I didn\u2019t know the answers to their caching questions, and I was too proud to say \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Had I done that, they would\u2019ve shifted gears. But I didn\u2019t, so they assumed I actually did know, then the grilling continued. If I could go back in time, I\u2019d do what our system design guide says to do when you\u2019re not certain, but you have an idea.\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/certainty_diagram_27234de7d3.webp)\n\nTell the interviewer:\n\n> *\"I don't know, I'm definitely going to look that up right after this interview, but if I had to give my best guess I'd say... [x] and here is why [explanation/thought process].\"*\n\nIn this clip, I get flustered, yell, and get a hint. Note that we swapped out both my voice and the interviewer\u2019s voice, so it sounds a bit robotic, but the content is preserved.\n\n### A moment I\u2019m proud of\n\nBreaking Google\u2019s record for the number of times \u201cHarry Styles\u201d is repeated in one interview! Just kidding. My actual proud moment was staying calm when the interviewer said something scary. A candidate who gets scared, looks like an outsider. To look like an insider, stay calm.\n\n> *A common system design question is \u2018Design Gmail.\u2019 There are so many different dimensions, no one can design Gmail during an interview. That can\u2019t happen. Whenever people ask you to \u2018Design Gmail,\u2019 that's to scare you.*\n>\n> -Former Staff Engineer at Google\n\nThe topic of scale came up. And the interviewer said this system should be able to support 800 million active users. That quote from that staff engineer popped into my head, so I\u2013while feigning the most casual tone possible\u2013responded with a neutral \u201cokay.\u201d The word choice and delivery suggest \u201cthis is another day at the office for me\u201d which implies \u201cI\u2019m not scared of this.\u201d In my head, what I told myself was \u201cI don\u2019t care that you don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nTalking about scale like you\u2019ve been there before \ud83d\ude0e Note that we swapped out both my voice and the interviewer\u2019s voice, so it sounds a bit robotic, but the content is correct.\n\n## The interviewer\u2019s feedback from the interview\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/feedback_93fb5e447f.png)\n\n**At 41:00, you can hear him give me a \u201cWeak/Lean Hire\u201d for L4.**\n\n## What I learned about system design interviews\n\nWithout a firm foundation, tricks lose their magic. You can have all the tricks in the world, but if you don\u2019t know [the material](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview), it won\u2019t be enough. That said, just knowing the material isn\u2019t enough either because doing well is also about managing your own psychology. The main mental obstacle is the discomfort of not knowing.\n\nSet yourself up for the least amount of discomfort. Book an anonymous, mock system design interview with engineers from top companies. Keep your skills sharp.\n\n[See available times](https://interviewing.io/signup)\n\n![](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcta.47351a0d.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nUnlike engineering problems, design problems are more about not knowing. There are no optimal solutions. Progress is not quantifiable. There are no predetermined outcomes. **It\u2019s not enough to sum them up as ambiguous; they test your ability to thrive in ambiguity. Luckily, this can be learned through practice.** It is a way to think, communicate, and solve problems. So, the skills you learn are transferable, even from practices that seem unrelated.\n\n## Three ways to practice \"not knowing\"\n\nThey are: the \"not knowing\" game, improv class, and zen koans. Try one for 10 days. If your system design interview skills don\u2019t improve, I\u2019ll buy you a Coke. Share your experience, tell us what we should write about next, and add anything else in the Typeform at the end of this post.\n\n### First way: The \"not-knowing\" game\n\nThe way to play is to notice who knows stuff you don\u2019t and then follow that thread. It\u2019s easier with a topic you\u2019re currently passionate about. For me, that\u2019s art. I bring it up and listen for it everywhere. If someone mentions something I didn\u2019t know, that\u2019s a point. If they explain something I didn\u2019t know, that\u2019s double points. And if someone scores enough points: treat them like an old friend and see where it goes.\n\nThe other day, a stranger and I began talking at a caf\u00e9. A half hour later, we were in their house looking at their original copy of Dante\u2019s Divine Trilogy which is about hell, purgatory, and heaven. It is hundreds of years old and surprisingly massive. Before this experience which was steeped in \"not knowing\"\u2013an impromptu visit to a stranger\u2019s house\u2013I hadn\u2019t even heard of this extremely rare art piece. After it, I had turned its pages (and not in a museum!!!).\n\n### Second way: Improv class\n\nIf unstructured conversation seems like hell, you might prefer an improv class such as clowning. There are two types of clowns: the high status (who \u201cknows\u201d) and the low status (who \u201cdoesn\u2019t know\u201d). Low status clowns do illogical things like jump when they\u2019re told to sit. They are the rule breaking dopey sidekicks. When playing one, you tell yourself you have no idea what\u2019s going on, and to be okay with that. This is similar to a meditative practice called \u201cdon\u2019t know mind.\u201d\n\n### Third way: Meditation\n\nIf strangers and clowns are scary, try meditation. Zen koans are a particularly baffling flavor of meditation. One is, \u201cWhat is the sound of one hand clapping?\u201d Another one is, \u201cWhat is your original face, before even your parents were born?\u201d Full of paradoxes and non-sequiturs which can\u2019t be figured out with a normal rational everyday way of thinking, zen koans can teach you to thrive in ambiguity by yourself on an app. Shout out to all the introverts out there.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo do well in system design interviews, you need to do two things: first and foremost, you need to learn the material. Then, you need to practice \u201cnot knowing\u201d to get better at handling ambiguity. With the ability to thrive in ambiguity, nothing in life is impossible. Without that ability, you might never crack that code, have that adventure, or save the world.\n\nWatch my full system design interview below:\n\nIn this clip, I try to score some points in the first 180 seconds of the interview. Note that we swapped out both my voice and the interviewer\u2019s voice, so it sounds a bit robotic, but the content is preserved.\n\nIf you have other topics you want us to write about, or feedback on this post, please leave it [here](https://iiosurveys.typeform.com/to/DvByB0ao).\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

The problem is that \u201ctech\u201d can mean anyone working at a tech company. You\u2019re an engineer? Of course, you\u2019re tech. You do ops? Great, you\u2019re tech. You do marketing? You, too, are tech! These are all critical roles at tech companies, and what I take umbrage with isn\u2019t the decision to label non-engineers as tech employees. It\u2019s deliberately misleading your audience by implying that \u201ctech\u201d refers to engineers specifically.\n\nI don\u2019t like imprecision, and I really don\u2019t like fear-mongering.

That\u2019ll be $46,282.\n\nBy Elliot Plant | Published: February 13, 2024\n\n**TL;DR: We sacrifice a lot to get the job we want, but the data says it\u2019s not more than $50k.**\n\nSoftware engineering jobs come with a lot of perks. We have modern offices, our hours are flexible, and recruiters assure us that our projects will change the world. But that doesn\u2019t mean our jobs are perfect. Work requires us to commute, reduces the time we can spend with family, increases our stress levels, and forces us to deal with stressed-out teammates. And sometimes we work for companies with questionable morals and use technologies we don\u2019t enjoy.\n\nFor some of us, it\u2019s worth trading cash for a job that fits into our lives better. But figuring out just how much money to give up is difficult without any data.\n\nSo we got the data.\n\nWe asked the interviewing.io audience about times they accepted a job offer with lower total compensation because they prioritized other aspects of the job. Surprisingly, it turns out that most engineers have never accepted an offer with lower monetary compensation. And for the engineers who have taken lower pay for higher values, we found that $50k was as much as most had sacrificed.\n\nIn this post, we\u2019re going to dive into what drives our compensation choices and how that can help you in your next job hunt.\n\n## When do we make compensation tradeoffs?\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re on your way to getting a new job. You\u2019ve applied to enough companies, performed well in your interviews, and now you have a stack of exciting offers in your inbox. Of course, you\u2019re negotiating your offers to make sure you\u2019re getting the best deals you can, but your first choice company is still offering you the third most compensation. Should you take the deal?\n\nOr, instead, imagine that you\u2019re working with a team you can\u2019t stand. Before starting to look for a new gig, wouldn\u2019t it be nice to figure out how much it costs to find a better team?\n\nWe all value perks differently, but it\u2019s important to know the market value of our values before making major life decisions.\n\n## How did you calculate $46,282?\n\nWe sent a survey to interviewing.io users that asked about times they\u2019d received multiple offers and had taken the offer with lower compensation. We wanted to know *why* they selected the lower offer and how much money they left on the table.\n\nFor respondents who had never taken a lower-comp offer, we asked what they *would* sacrifice compensation for. The results below are based on the primary (first ranked) reason respondents said they did (or would) accept a lower offer. We also asked everyone if they had advice for themselves for their next job hunt in a free-form response, which gave us some insight into how people make career decisions.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into the results to see which quality-of-life factors are valued the most.\n\n![Pie chart showing responses to a survey asking whether respondents had ever accepted a job offer with lower total compensation, with 70.4% selecting 'No' and 29.6% selecting 'Yes'.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ever_accepted_6455051b5c.png)\n\nOf the 480 responses, 70% have never taken an offer with lower compensation. It's clear that while money doesn\u2019t solve all of our problems, it certainly must solve a lot of them. There\u2019s no shame in taking the money \u2014 the majority of people do.\n\nSome respondents were in the fortunate position where their highest cash offer was also most aligned with other aspects of the job. If you find yourself in this scenario, consider yourself lucky.\n\nThe remaining 30% of respondents sacrificed an average of $47k to get something that was important to them.\n\n![Bar chart showing average pay cut based on primary reason for accepting lower job offer: Mission $51,300, Commute/Remote $46,282, Work/Life Balance $42,563, Technology $42,250, Prestige $41,214, Team $36,737](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pay_Cut_Avg_Reason_c1a932f1f7.png)\n\nThe differences in sacrificed pay between different reasons are quite small. The only significant difference was between Team ($37k) and Mission ($51k), which had the smallest and largest average loss in pay.\n\nMission may have required the largest pay drop because the type of companies that have positive missions tend to have less funding and profit (unfortunately). Their payrolls simply aren\u2019t as big as their \u201cevil\u201d competitors\u2019 payrolls.\n\nTeam may have required a significantly lower pay cut because it\u2019s not as concrete of a value as the others, so it\u2019s less worth paying for. Unlike commute time saved by working from home, it\u2019s much harder to quantify an increase in the likelihood you\u2019ll get along with your new teammates. We expect that makes it harder to justify a reduction in compensation.\n\n![Bar chart titled 'Pay difference bucketed by amount for all reasons' showing percentage of respondents per pay cut size range: 18% took cuts of $0-$9k and $20k-$24k, 13% took $30k-$34k cuts, 21% took $40k-$44k cuts, 9% took $50k-$54k cuts, 4% took $60k-$64k cuts, 1% each took $70k-$74k, $80k-$84k, $90k-$94k cuts, 6% took $95k-$99k cuts, 8% took over $100k pay cuts.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pay_Bucket_Reason_61625cfd30.png)\n\nAround the $50k mark, we see a considerable drop in the number of people who have taken lower pay for their values. There\u2019s a limit to how big of a pay cut we will accept for any reason, and that limit appears to be about $50k.\n\nWhile the reason for a pay cut appears to not be very significant, the *size* of the pay cut plays a huge role. We know that [money matters when recruiters reach out to us](https://blog.alinelerner.com/what-i-learned-from-reading-8000-recruiting-messages/), so it\u2019s not surprising that it also matters when we\u2019re accepting offers.\n\n## What about visas?\n\nSurely visa sponsorship doesn\u2019t abide by the $50k cutoff, right? After all, many of the items above could be considered a luxury, but visa sponsorship is not, and in some cases, you may not have many options when making this decision (e.g., if you were laid off and then have 60 days to find a new job before you have to leave the country[1](#user-content-fn-1)). After computing our initial set of results above, we realized that we had inadvertently left visas out, so we created a second survey about pay sacrifices for visa sponsorships. We asked our audience if they had ever taken a lower paying job to secure a visa, and we asked them to specify what type of visa they received: H-1B, H-1B transfer, non-H-1B, or non-H-1B transfer.\n\nWe expected visa sponsorship needs would lead to larger pay cuts than the less tangible requirements in our first survey. Surprisingly, we still found ourselves around the $50k mark.\n\n![Bar chart titled 'Average pay cut for visa types and non-visa' showing average difference from maximum offer in thousands of dollars: $51,428 for New Non H-1B visas, $49,051 for Transfer H-1B visas, $46,680 for New H-1B visas, $46,060 for Non-Visa situations.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pay_Cut_Avg_Visa_d4c90718d8.png)\n\nThe averages for new H-1B, new non-H-1B, and transferred H-1B visas were very close to each other and also not significantly different from the average pay cut for intangible, \u201cnon-visa\u201d reasons (from the first part of the post). Once again we see a cliff around $50k, beyond which we find few engineers willing to take a pay cut even for immigration status changes.\n\n![Bar chart titled 'Pay difference bucketed by amount for visa seekers' showing percentage of respondents per pay cut size range: 3% took $0-$4k cuts, 17% took $10k-$14k and $20k-$24k cuts, 22% took $40k-$44k cuts, 14% took $30k-$34k cuts, 8% took $50k-$54k cuts, 4% took $70k-$74k cuts, 1% took $80k-$84k cuts, 6% each took $90k-$94k and $95k-$99k cuts, 3% took over $100k pay cuts.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pay_Diff_Bucket_Visa_0271d34130.png)\n\nThe scarcity of accepted offers beyond a $50k pay cut shows us how highly engineers value cash. Both quality-of-life factors and more concrete rewards like visas are equally unlikely to entice them to accept less.\n\n## How do our projections compare to our actions?\n\nFinally, we wanted to know if the reasons engineers actually took lower paying jobs reflected the reasons that engineers said they would take lower jobs. For the engineers who had accepted a lower offer, we grouped them by the primary reason they stated for accepting that offer. For engineers who had never accepted a lower offer, we asked them what reasons, if any, they would hypothetically accept a lower offer, and we grouped those engineers by their primary reason.\n\n![Two pie charts comparing the primary reasons engineers have accepted or would accept lower paying job offers including work-life balance, commute, prestige, team, mission, and technology](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/reason_compare_41f6b761e9.png)\n\nThe reasons we *actually* accept lower-paying jobs appear to line up closely with the reason we *think* we would accept those jobs. Work/Life Balance is still the clear leader, but Commute/Remote takes up a much larger slice in the hypothetical situation than the real one. That may be a symptom of companies moving back into the office while their engineers want to stay remote. If you just lost your WFH flexibility, consider asking yourself how much you would pay to get it back.\n\n## Your next job hunt\n\nSo, what can you do with this information? At the beginning of your next job hunt, think critically about your values and consider how much you would pay to keep them. Most engineers in your shoes haven\u2019t sacrificed more than $50k for any reason, so be wary of extending beyond that limit.\n\nIf you value working from home but your WFH option pays $10k less, you\u2019re actually getting a great deal compared to your peers. If, on the other hand, you have an offer for a team you\u2019d like to work with more, but it comes with a $80k pay cut, consider that you\u2019re losing roughly twice the average of other engineers looking for the same thing.\n\nIf you set yourself up in a strong negotiating position by getting multiple offers, leverage them to make your favorite company compensate you as well as your not-quite-as-great-but-higher-paying choice. If you can\u2019t get them to match, at least try to get them within $50k.\n\nLife isn\u2019t all about money, but it\u2019s up to you to make sure you\u2019re paid what you\u2019re worth.\n\n![Author avatar](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FElliot_Headshot_a87ff0cadc.jpeg&w=384&q=75 \"Elliot Plant\")\n\nElliot Plant\n\nElliot Plant enjoys everything about building.

Anonymous technical interview practice for all!\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: June 3, 2020; Last updated: May 1, 2023\n\nI started [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/) 5 years ago. After working as both an engineer and a recruiter, my frustration with how inefficient and unfair hiring had reached a boiling point. What made me especially angry was that despite mounting evidence that resumes are [poor predictors of aptitude](http://blog.alinelerner.com/resumes-suck-heres-the-data/%22%20target), employers were obsessed with where people had gone to school and worked previously. In my mind, any great engineer, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to get their foot in the door wherever they choose.\n\nSo, we set out to build a better system. On interviewing.io, software engineers can book anonymous mock interviews with senior engineers from companies like Facebook, Google, and others, and if they do well in practice, get fast-tracked with top employers regardless of how they look on paper. Fast-tracking means that you bypass resume screens, scheduling emails, and recruiter calls, and go straight to the technical interview (which, by the way, is still anonymous [1](#user-content-fn-1)) at companies of your choice. **Because we use interview data, not resumes, our candidates end up getting hired consistently by companies like Facebook, Uber, Twitch, Lyft, Dropbox, and many others, and 40% of the hires we\u2019ve made to date have been candidates from non-traditional backgrounds.** What\u2019s nuts is that many of our candidates have literally been rejected based on their resumes by the same employer who later hired them when they came through interviewing.io. **One notable candidate was rejected *three* times from a top-tier public company based on his resume before he got hired at that same company through us.**\n\nOver the past 5 years, we\u2019ve hosted over 50,000 technical interviews (both practice and real) on our platform. Our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNc-Wa_ZNBAGzFkYbAHw9eg), where you can watch other people interview, has gotten over 3.5M views, and, most importantly, we have helped thousands of engineers get great jobs.\n\n![Screenshot of a live and anonymous interview](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7ff46_screenshot_2020_06_03_15_57_12_894fcecad3.webp&w=1920&q=75 \"A live and anonymous interview\")\n\nAll practice interviews are completely anonymous and include actionable, high-fidelity feedback\n\n**Despite that for our entire, multi-year existence, we\u2019ve been in beta. Over the past year or so, this increasingly inaccurately named \u201cbeta\u201d became kind of a smoke screen.** Our product was stable, we had plenty of interviewers, but sadly, we couldn\u2019t serve many of the people who needed us most. Because we made money by charging companies for hires, despite a growing waitlist of >180,000 engineers, we could only serve the ones whom we had a shot at placing, i.e. engineers who 1) were located in a city where we had customers and 2) had 4 or more years of experience\u2060\u2014sadly, despite our best efforts, employers across the board were not willing to pay for junior hires.\n\nThen, COVID-19 happened and with it, a deluge of hiring slowdowns and freezes. In a matter of weeks, we found ourselves down from 7-figure revenue to literally nothing. Companies didn\u2019t really want or need to pay for hiring anymore.\n\nBut these hiring slowdowns freezes weren\u2019t just affecting us. In parallel, we saw a growing sea of layoffs, and we realized that, soon, more and more candidates would be vying for a shrinking number of jobs. **On top of that, because a disproportionate amount of layoffs targeted recruiters, an overworked in-house skeleton recruiting team would go back to relying on resumes and other old-school proxies, unintentionally marginalizing non-traditional candidates once again**. We also realized that many of the folks getting laid off would be here on visas, which meant that they\u2019d have a paltry 60 days to find their next job or risk deportation.\n\nSo, we made a hard call. You may know that historically, we\u2019ve offered *completely free* mock interviews. What you may not know, is that we pay our professional interviewers, as it\u2019s the only way to ensure that we have seasoned, experienced engineers delivering a consistent, realistic, and high-quality experience. This is often our largest expense.\n\nSince we previously funded practice by charging companies for hires, we had to find another revenue stream to continue. In the face of either shutting down the company, unable to provide any practice at all, or to begin to charge for premium practice interviews, we made the choice to launch a paid tier. But, because charging for practice felt anathema to our mission, we knew we needed some ground rules in place. I started this company to fix hiring, after all, and that\u2019s why the people who work at interviewing.io are here, too.\n\nAfter 50,000 interviews, our data shows that [where someone goes to school has no correspondence to their interview performance](https://interviewing.io/blog/we-looked-at-how-a-thousand-college-students-performed-in-technical-interviews-to-see-if-where-they-went-to-school-mattered-it-didnt). Despite that, we are all too aware that just because aptitude is uniformly distributed among populations, resources are not. We understand that paying for interviews will be prohibitive to many of the people who need help most, so our ground rules and goals for this pivot were as follows:\n\n- We\u2019d ALWAYS have a free tier\n- We\u2019d immediately start working on a fellowship for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds or in a visa crisis experiencing financial hardship\n- We\u2019d find a way to let people defer their payments\n\nThere is an upside to our new model though. Now that we\u2019re no longer strictly beholden to employers, we\u2019re able to open up interviewing.io to engineers of all seniority levels and many more locations. And because our revenue isn\u2019t coming from placements but directly from practice, we don\u2019t have to constrain our users to a limited number of practice interviews.\n\n**So, as of today, interviewing.io is open to engineers of all experience levels in North America and the UK**. Engineers who sign up can book mock interviews 24 hours out, and top performers will still get fast-tracked for great jobs.[2](#user-content-fn-2)\n\n![Screenshot of the interview scheduler wizard - picking an interviewer type, the type of interview and a timeslot](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fedfb7_dashboard_1_71ade2a5c3.webp&w=1920&q=75 \"Scheduling an interview\")\n\nYou can book either free (peer practice with other users) or premium interviews with experienced interviewers from FAANG, as early as 24 hours out\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n\n- **If you\u2019re able to pay, you can now book unlimited interviews with professional interviewers from FAANG and other top companies.** We\u2019re no longer constraining you to 2 or 3, and we have the interviewer supply to make this work. Interviews cost between $100 and $225.\n- **If you can\u2019t pay, there\u2019s a free tier where you can do peer practice with other users.**\n\nWhat about the goals and ground rules above? We\u2019ve already made some headway against these. The free tier was there from day one. Moreover, a number of our professional interviewers have stepped up and volunteered their time to help the people who need it most prepare for free (if you\u2019d like to volunteer your time to help engineers from underrepresented groups practice interviewing, please email [interviewers@interviewing.io](mailto:interviewers@interviewing.io) with the subject line \u2018Volunteer\u2019), and a formal fellowship is in the works. Lastly, we\u2019re working on a deferred payment plan, where users who buy premium interviews will not have to pay us for them until they find their next job.\n\n![Screenshot of a zoom meeting with the whole team](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F73996_teamzoom_1aeec85ecf.webp&w=1920&q=75 \"The team\")\n\nCOVID-19 has changed a lot of things for our team (that\u2019s us above doing the remote work thing). But not how much we want to fix hiring.\n\nLook, whether you got laid off, are a student who\u2019s reeling from your internship being withdrawn, lost your visa, whether you\u2019re fortunate enough to still be employed but worry about your job stability, or if you just want to help making hiring fairer, we hope you\u2019ll [take us for a spin](https://interviewing.io/). Technical interviews are hard, and hiring is broken. And whether you\u2019re new to interviewing or are just rusty after being off the market, and whether you can pay or not, we have your back.\n\nThe coming months are going to be hard. We know that in the current climate more people than ever are feeling helpless, and the world feels like it\u2019s burning. And it might not even seem like technical interviews matter that much. But they do to us\u2026 because this is our way of creating a world where access to opportunity isn\u2019t determined by who you are or where you come from but by what you can do.\n\nP.S. If you don\u2019t need practice for yourself but you or your organization want to help others get awesome at technical interviews, check out our [new gifting feature](https://interviewing.io/gift-practice-interviews).\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. \"Unlike other hiring marketplaces, we will always be an anonymous platform. No public profiles, no sharing of candidate information, and no one but you gets access to your interview history.

We\u2019ve written before about [how important good copy is and how it can elevate less well-known brands](https://interviewing.io/blog/3-exercises-to-create-the-kind-of-employer-brand-that-actually-makes-engineers-want-to-work-for-you), but the exercise of having to write job descriptions for ourselves made me realize that giving advice is a lot easier than following it and that even we, who make a living from hiring, tend to fall into some of the same traps that we tell others to avoid.\n\nSo I thought I\u2019d write this guide to keep us honest and to hopefully say some useful stuff to others undertaking this somewhat herculean task.\n\nBefore I get into the practical do\u2019s and don\u2019ts, a bit of theory.\n\n## How to avoid the \u201caudience paradox\u201d\n\nWhen you start writing a job description, the first question you should ask yourself is, *Am I trying to attract the right people, or am I trying to keep the wrong people out?*\n\nThen, once you answer it, write for that audience deliberately, because it\u2019s really hard to write for both (if you try, you\u2019ll find that your job description will end up being way too long, and then you\u2019ll attract\u2026 neither!)\n\nWhy is it hard to write for both? When you\u2019re trying to attract talent, your tone is going to be different. You\u2019re going to focus on cool stuff about the company, projects they\u2019re going to do, the impact they\u2019ll have, initiatives and outcomes that they\u2019re going to own.\n\nWhen you try to keep people out, the focus tends to be more on a long laundry list of requirements.\n\nMost job descriptions that I\u2019ve seen tend to focus on keeping the wrong people out, though I doubt that doing so was a deliberate choice \u2014 when people write these, it\u2019s generally their first instinct to optimize for less noise. Why? Because when you post job descriptions, you inevitably get a bunch of unqualified candidates in. If you\u2019re spending any meaningful time on hiring, others are too, and you\u2019re probably in a hot market. In these markets, more and more unqualified candidates try to get in because salaries go up.\n\nAt the same time, in hot markets, fewer and fewer qualified candidates apply for jobs because companies start going after them (this is why sourcers and recruiters exist).\n\nThe paradox here is that, despite the noise, writing job descriptions that aim to reduce it will actually get you *fewer* qualified candidates (and will not cut the unqualified ones).\n\nUnqualified candidates have nothing to lose by applying to you, and no amount of bullet points will keep them out. On the other hand, writing job descriptions that, first and foremost, get people excited might actually get you some good people. Below is a succinct way of putting it.\n\n![Chart: the audience paradox](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fjob_descriptions_graph_9d898422e8.webp&w=1200&q=75 \"The Audience Paradox\")\n\nSo, no matter what, your goal should be to attract talent rather than worrying about the noise.\n\n## If they mostly attract noise, why even write job descriptions?\n\nIt\u2019s true that in hot markets, most hires don\u2019t come from inbound applicants. However, writing good ones still matters. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. They help you collect your thoughts and align internally on what you need\n2. They help you figure out how you\u2019re going to talk about the job to candidates\n3. Many candidates who come from outbound sources (i.e. you go out to get them rather than them coming to you) will still want to see the job description so they can have something concrete to reference when they\u2019re trying to grok the job\n\n## The anatomy of a good job description\n\n### An \u201cAbout us\u201d section\n\n*(1 paragraph)* Come up with a good general company summary. In a previous post, we listed some [exercises that will help you distill what makes your company special](https://interviewing.io/blog/3-exercises-to-create-the-kind-of-employer-brand-that-actually-makes-engineers-want-to-work-for-you).\n\n*(1 paragraph)* Contextualize the above for the specific team/department you\u2019re hiring for. In other words, how does this specific team/department fit in to what you\u2019re working on as a whole? What has made that department/team special, unique, or impactful til now? For instance, if your eng team is punching above their weight because it\u2019s a small team producing outsized results, mention that. If you\u2019re using some programming language that has a big community around it or you\u2019re an early adopter of a cool language, mention that. If this is a design job description, and you\u2019re a design-first culture or the founder is a designer, mention that. And so on.\n\n### An \u201cAbout you & what you\u2019ll do here\u201d section\n\n#### About you\n\nList your requirements, but only list actual objective deal-breakers. People tend to get really carried away in this section and come up with huge laundry lists full of subjective things like \u201cFollows coding best practices\u201d. Imagine someone reading the job description, and put yourself in their shoes. Will you really weed someone out because reading that bullet will be the watershed moment in their life, where they honestly admit that they have not, in fact, been following best practices? Remember, the point of a job description is to sell good people, not keep out bad ones! Do you think that putting a bullet about following best practices is going to get someone excited to work for you? Probably not. Following best practices is table stakes, as are most other requirements of that ilk.\n\nHere are examples of good bullets. Note that they\u2019re specific to the role at hand and that not being able to do them would actually be a dealbreaker for the role in question:\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Clean_Shot_2022_12_16_at_17_09_09_2x_e733d9c740.png)\n\nAnd here are examples of bad bullets (pulled from real job descriptions). Note that these are bad not because they\u2019re not true (they are!) but because they won\u2019t keep anyone out and just create noise and detract attention away from the parts that attract the best people:\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Clean_Shot_2022_12_16_at_17_09_14_2x_b8f55142ca.png)\n\n#### What you\u2019ll do here\n\nList all the cool things that this person will get to do and work on. This is really important. Do NOT put generic things like \u201cWill work with key stakeholders to drive KPIs\u201d. Put very specific things that will excite the best candidates. The purpose is to get the best people excited, nothing more.\n\nHere are examples of good bullets:\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Clean_Shot_2022_12_16_at_17_09_34_2x_d448bfa95d.png)\n\nAnd here are examples of bad bullets (pulled from real job descriptions). Again, these are bad not because they\u2019re untrue but because they\u2019re generic and unmemorable. A good litmus test is, \u201cCan most companies say this about the work they\u2019re doing?\u201d. Below you can see bullets that pertain to almost every eng role ever:\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Clean_Shot_2022_12_16_at_17_09_42_2x_6b1b3cfd8e.png)\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

I know it seems like we are talking about interviewing all the time, but we are usually talking about only one half of the equation: How to be a good candidate. What about the other half? What about the interviewer?\n\nIn the last decade, there has been an explosion of attention for candidates and how to improve their interview performance. This stands in stark contrast to the preparation of the *interviewer*. If you are lucky, your interviewer might have gotten a two hour class on how to ask only bona fide work related questions and has sat through two shadow interviews. Maybe they have even done a few interviews! Consequently, there is a lot of bad interviewing being done.

If you\u2019re a top performer on interviewing.io, we fast-track you at the world\u2019s best companies.\n\nWe make money in two ways: engineers pay us for mock interviews, and employers pay us for access to the best performers.

To keep our employer customers happy, we have to make sure that the engineers we send them are way better than the ones they\u2019re getting without us. Otherwise, it\u2019s just not worth it for them.\n\nThis means that we live and die by the quality of our interviewers, in a way that no single employer does, no matter how much they say they care about people analytics or interviewer metrics or training.

The problem is that \u201ctech\u201d can mean anyone working at a tech company. You\u2019re an engineer? Of course, you\u2019re tech. You do ops? Great, you\u2019re tech. You do marketing? You, too, are tech! These are all critical roles at tech companies, and what I take umbrage with isn\u2019t the decision to label non-engineers as tech employees.

Lack of feedback, or feedback that doesn\u2019t come right away, isn\u2019t just frustrating to candidates. It\u2019s bad for business. We did a whole study on this. It turns out that candidates chronically underrate and overrate their technical interview performance, like so: Where this finding starts to get actionable is that there\u2019s a statistically significant relationship between whether people think they did well in an interview and whether they\u2019d want to work with you.

Time to hire is important because it lets you plan \u2014 if a given role has historically taken 3 months to fill, you\u2019re going to act differently when you need to fill it again than if it takes 2 weeks.

Here's the data.\n\nBy Aline Lerner and Peter Bergman | Published: April 30, 2024; Last updated: May 19, 2024\n\n*This post is a very exciting first for interviewing.io because it\u2019s about a proper experiment run by a real, live academic research lab. If you\u2019ve been reading my work for the past decade, you know that I\u2019ve always been something of an armchair researcher. I ran some experiments before starting interviewing.io, and since then, my team and I have [kept it up](https://interviewing.io/blog/category/data-deep-dives).*\n\n*One of the experiments I ran before I founded interviewing.io was an attempt to figure out how good recruiters were at judging candidate quality based on resumes. I ran it 10 years ago and discovered that not only was everyone bad at judging resumes (about as accurate as flipping a coin), [they all disagreed with each other about what a good candidate looked like](https://blog.alinelerner.com/resumes-suck-heres-the-data/).*\n\n*Even though these results were shocking at the time, the study had some serious limitations. First, I had no objective measures for which candidates were actually good. I was working as a recruiter at the time, so I knew whom I had been able to place, but that\u2019s obviously not the be-all and end-all of engineering ability. Second, I had a non-representative sample of software engineers. Due to my brand, I had managed to attract a lot of excellent, non-traditional candidates \u2014 engineers who were actually very good but didn\u2019t look good on paper. These types of resumes are the hardest for recruiters to judge, and the data was full of them. Finally, my sample size wasn\u2019t that big: I ended up with 716 data points in total, only about half of which came from recruiters (the rest came from engineers and hiring managers \u2014 my original hypothesis was that they might be better at the task, but I was wrong\u2026 everyone was bad at judging resumes).*\n\n*So, now that I\u2019m CEO of interviewing.io, with access to a lot more data, resources, and a team of excellent academics at [Learning Collider](https://www.learningcollider.org/), we decided to run this study again, but with a more rigorous treatment and better conditions, to see if we could replicate the results. This time, we focused just on recruiters, given that they\u2019re most often the gatekeepers who decide which candidates get an interview.*\n\n***Below are all the details, but here\u2019s the TL;DR: we reproduced my results from 10 years ago! Our new study showed that recruiters were only a bit better than a coin flip at making value judgments, and they still all disagreed with each other about what a good candidate looks like.***\n\n*In this piece, we also talk about:*\n\n- *How far off recruiters were in their predictions and how much they disagreed with each other*\n- *What recruiters say they look for vs. what the data shows they actually look for*\n- *Why recruiters taking more time to parse resumes would lead to better outcomes (median parse time is just 31 seconds)*\n- *Whether AI can do a better job at judging resumes (spoiler: yes, it can)*\n\n*The rest of this piece is co-authored by Peter Bergman, Tushar Kundu, and Kadeem Noray of Learning Collider.*\n\n---\n\n## The setup\n\nIn the real world, resumes (or LinkedIn profiles) are evaluated by recruiters in minutes \u2014 even seconds \u2014 and these evaluations are THE thing that determines who gets an interview.\n\nBut what do these word walls tell recruiters? How predictive are their evaluations of actual interview success? Ultimately, how good are recruiters at judging resumes?\n\nTo answer these questions, we designed a study approximating technical recruiters\u2019 decisions in the real world. We asked[1](#user-content-fn-1) 76 technical recruiters (both agency and in-house) to review and make judgments about 30 engineers\u2019 resumes each, just as they would in their current roles.\n\nThey answered two questions per resume:\n\n- Would you interview this candidate?[2](#user-content-fn-2) (Yes or No)\n- What is the likelihood this candidate will pass the technical interview (as a percentage)?\n\nWe ended up with nearly 2,200 evaluations of over 1,000 resumes.\n\nThe resumes in this study belonged to interviewing.io users (with their consent) \u2014 actual engineers currently on the job market.\n\nCollaborating on this study with interviewing.io is an ideal scenario, precisely because outcome data were available for comparison purposes. Each engineer in this study has completed multiple mock interviews on the platform. Performance in these interviews is quite predictive of performance in real interviews: top performers (roughly the top 5% of users) on interviewing.io are 3X more likely to pass technical interviews at top-tier companies than candidates from other sources. Even passing a single interview on interviewing.io is a strong predictor of outcomes; it's associated with a 32% increase in the chance of working at a FAANG company post-interview.\n\nOnce we had recruiters\u2019 evaluations of the resumes, we compared them to how those engineers actually performed on interviewing.io: skills scores, feedback from interviewers, and ultimately, whether they passed or failed their mock interviews.\n\n## Recruiters\u2019 resume judgments are just slightly better than a coin flip\n\n### Question #1: Would you interview this candidate?\n\nIn aggregate, recruiters in the study recommended 62% of candidates for an interview. But how did recruiter evaluations stack up against candidates\u2019 performance on the platform?\n\n**We calculated recruiter accuracy by treating each candidate\u2019s first interview (pass/fail) as the truth, and recruiters\u2019 decision to interview as a prediction. It turns out that recruiters chose correctly 55% of the time, which is just slightly better than a coin flip.**\n\n### Question #2: What is the likelihood this candidate will pass the technical interview?\n\nRecruiters predicted the likelihood that each candidate would pass the technical interview. In most hiring processes, the technical interview follows the recruiter call and determines whether candidates proceed to the onsite. Being able to accurately predict which candidates will succeed at this stage is important and should inform the decision about whether to interview the candidate or not.\n\n**What we found most surprising is how far their predictions were from the truth:**\n\n**- When recruiters predicted the lowest probability of passing (0-5%), those candidates actually passed the technical interview with a 47% probability.**- **When recruiters predicted the highest probability of passing (95-100%), those candidates actually passed with a 64% probability.**\n\nBelow is a graph that shows recruiter predictions vs. actual performance. The x-axis is the bucketed recruiter rating. In other words, the first point is all the candidates that recruiters assigned a 0-5% likelihood of passing. The y-axis is the average interviewing.io pass rate for those candidates. The red dotted line represents 100% accuracy \u2013 in an ideal world, the higher a recruiter's ranking of a candidate, the higher their actual performance would be. The orange line represents reality \u2013 as you can see, there isn\u2019t much correspondence between how recruiters predicted candidates would perform and their actual performance.\n\n![recruiter predictions vs interviewing.io performance](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fpredictions_0e401e8d92.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nRecruiters\u2019 predictions below 40% underestimate these candidates by an average of 23 percentage points. Above 60%, they\u2019re overestimating by an average of 20 percentage points. **If this was predicting student performance, recruiters would be off by two full letter grades.**\n\n## Recruiters can\u2019t agree on what a good candidate looks like\n\nClearly, there is lots of noise in resume evaluations. Were recruiters\u2019 noisy judgments at least consistent when reviewing the same resumes?\n\nNearly 500 resumes were evaluated by more than one recruiter. Based on a random selection of two evaluations per resume, the overall likelihood of two recruiters agreeing to either interview or not interview a given candidate was 64%.\n\nSince recruiters also guess the probability a candidate will pass the technical interview, we can compare how different these guesses are for a given candidate. **The average differential between two randomly selected recruiters\u2019 evaluations of the same resume was 41 percentage points. So, let\u2019s say one recruiter predicts a 30% probability the candidate would pass; another recruiter evaluating the same resume would predict, on average, a 71% probability of passing.**\n\nTo further understand just how prevalent the disagreement is, we looked at the standard deviations for across-candidate evaluations and same-candidate evaluations:\n\n- 0.34 across different candidates\n- 0.32 across the same candidates\n\n**So, when two recruiters are asked to judge the same candidate, their level of disagreement is nearly the same as if they evaluated two completely different candidates.**\n\n## The most sought-after resume attributes\n\n**Despite the noise and variability in the study\u2019s resume evaluations, there were some characteristics that recruiters consistently favored: experience at a top-tier tech[3](#user-content-fn-3) company (FAANG or FAANG-adjacent) and URM (underrepresented minority) status (in tech, this means being Black or Hispanic).**\n\nMost predictive for Question #1 (whether a recruiter would want to interview that candidate) was experience at a top company \u2014 these candidates were 35% more likely to be picked. Black or Hispanic candidates are also associated with an increased likelihood a recruiter would interview a candidate \u2014 by 21%.[4](#user-content-fn-4)\n\nWith Question #2 (how likely the candidate was to pass a technical interview), having a top company on your resume is associated with a 21% increase in the likelihood that recruiters believe the candidate will pass the interview. Compared to the actual pass rates, recruiters\u2019 predictions of FAANG candidates are generally accurate (average 4 percentage point overestimate).[5](#user-content-fn-5) Unlike the presence of a top company, URM status didn't appear to influence recruiter decisions here.\n\n## How do recruiters\u2019 stated reasons for rejecting candidates line up with actual rejection reasons?\n\nSo, we know what recruiters tend to favor, whether they\u2019d admit to it or not: 1) FAANG/FAANG-adjacent experience and 2) URM status. But what\u2019s even more interesting than why a recruiter would say yes is why they would say no.\n\nWhen we asked recruiters to judge a resume, we also asked them WHY they made that decision.[6](#user-content-fn-6) Below are recruiters\u2019 stated reasons for rejecting candidates. As you can see, \u201cmissing skill\u201d is the main reason by far, with \u201cno top firm\u201d a distant third.\n\n![Bar chart of recruiter's stated reasons for rejection](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Frej_reasons_full_a70e7af161.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nSo, then, we wondered\u2026 How do recruiters\u2019 stated reasons for rejecting candidates line up with reality? To figure that out, we analyzed the resumes that ended up in the rejected pile and looked at common traits.\n\n**Below is a graph of actual rejection reasons, based on our analysis. The main rejection reason isn\u2019t \u201cmissing skill\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s \u201cno top firm.\u201d This is followed, somewhat surprisingly, but much less reliably (note the huge error bars), by having an MBA. \u201cNo top school\u201d and having a Master\u2019s degree come in at third and fourth. Note that these top four rejection reasons are all based on a candidate\u2019s background, NOT their skill set.**\n\n![Predictors of recruiter rejections](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Frej_regression_8776500012.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nThe y-axis is the coefficient from regressing rejection on that variable. So, a coefficient of Y for a given trait means that trait is associated with a Y\\*100% percentage point increase in the likelihood of being rejected.\n\n## Slowing down is associated with better decisions\n\nAnother key piece of this study is time. In hiring settings, recruiters make decisions quickly. Moving stacks of candidates through the funnel gives little room to second-guess or even wait before determining whether or not to give a candidate the opportunity to interview.\n\nIn our study, **the median time spent on resume evaluations was just 31 seconds**. Broken down further by Question #1 \u2014 whether or not the recruiter would interview them \u2014 the median time spent was:\n\n- 25 seconds for those advanced to a technical interview\n- 44 seconds for those placed in the reject pile\n\n![Distribution of time taken to evaluate candidates](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ftimetaken_yesno_b30ffa76f7.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nGiven the weight placed on single variables (e.g., experience at a top firm), how quickly recruiters make judgments isn\u2019t surprising. But might they be more accurate if they slowed down? **It turns out that spending more time on resume evaluations, notably >45 seconds, is associated with more accurate predictions \u2014 just spending 15 more seconds appears to increase accuracy by 34%.[7](#user-content-fn-7) It could be that encouraging recruiters to slow down might result in more accurate resume screening.**\n\n![Recruiter accuracy vs time taken](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Frecruiter_accuracytime_f308373dfa.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\n## Can AI do better?\n\nAs a gaggle of technologists and data geeks, we tested whether algorithms could quiet the noise and inconsistencies in recruiters\u2019 predictions.\n\nWe trained two local, off-the-rack machine-learning models.[8](#user-content-fn-8)\n\nJust like human recruiters, the models were trained to predict which candidates would pass technical interviews. The training dataset was drawn from interviewing.io and included anonymized resume data (years of experience, whether they had worked at a top firm, and whether they had attended a top 10 school for either grad or undergrad), candidates\u2019 race and gender, and interview outcomes.[9](#user-content-fn-9)\n\n**Despite the very limited types of data we input into both models, when presented with out-of-sample candidate profiles, both models made predictions more accurately than human recruiters.**\n\nRandom Forest was somewhat more accurate than recruiters when predicting lower performing candidates. XGBoost, however, was more accurate across the board than both the Random Forest model AND recruiters.\n\n![predictions vs interviewing.io performance](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fprediction_comp_e3cf3757f5.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\n## Where does this leave us?\n\nIn this section, when we say \u201cwe,\u201d we are speaking as interviewing.io, not as the researchers involved in this study. Just FYI.\n\n### Advice for candidates\n\nAt interviewing.io, we routinely get requests from our users to add resume review to our list of offerings. So far, we have declined to build it. Why? Because we suspected that recruiters, regardless of what they say publicly, primarily hunt for name brands on your resume. Therefore, highlighting your skills or acquiring new skills is unlikely to make a big difference in your outcomes.\n\nWe are sad to see the numbers back up our intuition that it mostly is about brands.[10](#user-content-fn-10) As such, here\u2019s an actionable piece of advice: maintain a healthy skepticism when recruiters advise you to grow your skill set. Acquiring new skills will very likely make you a better engineer. But it will very likely NOT increase your marketability.\n\nIf enhancing your skill set won\u2019t help, what can you do to get in front of companies? We\u2019re in the midst of a brutal market, the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen since the dot-com crash in 2000. According to anecdotes shared in our Discord community, even engineering managers from FAANGs are getting something like a 10% response rate when they apply to companies online. If that\u2019s true, what chance do the rest of us have?\n\nWe strongly encourage anyone looking for work in this market, especially if you come from a non-traditional background, to stop spending energy on applying online, full stop. Instead, reach out to hiring managers. The numbers will be on your side there, as relatively few candidates are targeting hiring managers directly. We plan to write a full blog post on how to do this kind of outreach well, but this CliffsNotes version will get you started:\n\n- Get a LinkedIn Sales Navigator account\n- Make a target list of hiring managers at the companies you\u2019re interested in\n- Figure out their emails (you can use a tool like RocketReach), and send them something short and personalized. Do not use LinkedIn. The same way that you don\u2019t live in LinkedIn, eng managers don\u2019t either. Talk about the most impressive thing you\u2019ve built. Ask them about their work, if you can find a blog post they\u2019ve written or a project they\u2019ve worked on publicly. Tie those two things together, and you\u2019ll see a much higher response rate. Writing these personalized emails takes time, of course, but in this market, it\u2019s what you need to do to stand out.\n\n### Advice for recruiters\n\nWe know that recruiting is a tough job, especially in the current climate, where there are more applicants than ever and fewer recruiters to parse through them. So, it rationally makes sense to us that a recruiter would spend no more than 30 seconds per resume and focus primarily on looking for top brands.\n\nWe hope, though, that this piece may have given a measure of pause about your approach, and we\u2019d like to leave you with two actionable pieces of advice. First, if you do nothing else, please slow down. As you saw above, taking just 15 extra seconds to read a resume could improve your accuracy by 34%.[11](#user-content-fn-11)\n\nOur second piece of advice is this. Freada Kapor Klein from Kapor Capital coined the term \u201cdistance traveled\u201d more than two decades ago. It refers to what someone accomplished, in the context of where they started. For instance, Kapor Klein recommends that, in their admissions processes, universities should consider not just the number of AP tests a candidate has passed but the number of AP tests divided by the total number offered at their high school. For example, if an applicant took 5 AP tests and their school offered 27, that paints a very different picture from another applicant who also took 5 AP tests when that\u2019s the total number offered at their school. Kapor Capital uses distance traveled as one of their metrics for determining which entrepreneurs to fund. One can easily apply this concept to hiring as well.\n\nTake a look at the resume below. \"John\" (name has been changed; scrubbed resume shared with permission) studied chemical engineering and worked his way into software engineering by starting as a service engineer focused on pen testing. In the meantime, he completed a bootcamp, attended the Bradfield School of Computer Science (a school dedicated to teaching computer science at a depth beyond what many university programs, and certainly most bootcamps, offer), and ended up with a senior title in just three years.\n\nJohn was consistently rated poorly by recruiters but is one of the top performers on interviewing.io.\n\n![anonymized resume](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fanonymized_resume_55980a6854.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nIt takes just a bit more time, so please spend a little longer reading resumes, and evaluate candidates\u2019 achievements in the context of where they came from. Think about the denominator. But don\u2019t think for a moment that we recommend that you lower the bar \u2014 absolutely not. On interviewing.io, we regularly see candidates like John objectively outperforming their FAANG counterparts.\n\n### What this means for our industry\n\nThe last time I did this research, I wrote about how being bad at judging resumes isn\u2019t anything to be ashamed about and that comes down to the resume itself being a low-signal and not-very-useful document.\n\nI held that same opinion for the last decade (and even wrote a [recent post about how AI can\u2019t do recruiting](https://interviewing.io/blog/why-ai-cant-do-hiring))\u2026 right up until we ran this study and successfully built two ML models that outperformed recruiters.\n\nSo, I stand corrected.\n\nAs you saw above, both models were limited \u2013 they were looking at the same types of features that recruiters do when they quickly scan a resume, certainly fewer features than recruiters have access to. But, despite that, the AI models still outperformed humans. What happens then, if you can build a model that behaves like a recruiter who really slows down and reads everything? These results make me believe that resumes do carry some signal, and you can uncover it if you carefully read what people write about their jobs and themselves and also analyze how they write it. Unfortunately, this takes more time and effort to uncover than most human recruiters are able to devote. And, in retrospect, that\u2019s a good task for AI. Though we haven\u2019t built a model like that for this post, I\u2019m optimistic that we may be able to do it in the future.\n\nAs I said in the AI piece I linked above, in order for AI to do useful recruiting work, rather than just perpetuating the biases that human recruiters hold, it needs a data set that contains some objective measure of performance. Most recruiting AI models today do one of three things: glorified keyword matching, training on what recruiters prefer (the outcome is whether a recruiter would want to talk to the candidate, NOT whether the candidate is good), or live on top of existing tools like ChatGPT (which [we recently showed doesn\u2019t perform very well and is biased against non-traditional candidates](https://interviewing.io/blog/refuting-bloombergs-analysis-chatgpt-isnt-racist)). These three approaches just result in the wrong thing being done, faster.\n\nI hope that, in the not too distant future, we can use AI to make less-biased decisions, using meaningful performance data. And I hope that this type of AI solution can get adoption among the recruiting community.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. Participating technical recruiters were paid a base rate and then received additional $$ for each accurate prediction. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n2. Different roles have different requirements. To correct for that, we asked each candidate to specify which eng role they were applying for: Software Engineer (back-end or full-stack), Mobile Engineer, Front-end Engineer, ML Engineer, Data Engineer, or Engineering Manager. Then we prompted recruiters to evaluate them specifically for that role. If no role was specified by the candidate, the default role to evaluate for was Software Engineer (back-end or full-stack). [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-2)\n3. Top firms = Airbnb, Amazon, Anthropic, AWS, Apple, Asana, Atlassian, Bloomberg LP, Checkr, Coinbase, Coursera, Cruise, Dropbox, Etsy, Facebook, Flexport, GitHub, Google, Gusto, HashiCorp, Instacart, Instagram, Jane Street, Jump Trading, Khan Academy, LinkedIn, Lyft, Medium, Microsoft, Mozilla, Netflix, Oculus, OpenAI, Palantir, Peloton, Pinterest, Postmates, Quora, Reddit, Robinhood, Roblox, Salesforce, Segment, Slack, Snap, Snowflake, SpaceX, Spotify, Square, Stripe, Tesla, Thumbtack, TikTok, Twilio, Twitch, Twitter, Two Sigma, Uber, Udemy, Waymo, Whatsapp, Yelp, and Zoom. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-3)\n4. We corrected by FAANG & FAANG-adjacent experience (and all of our other variables) before making this statement, i.e., the effect existed for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds who did not have FAANG/FAANG-adjacent companies on their resumes. We expect that recruiters favor underrepresented minority candidates because of guidelines from their employers to focus on sourcing these types of candidates, as part of DEI initiatives. Discussion about the magnitude of this effect and its implications is out of scope of this piece. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-4)\n5. Interestingly, recruiters might penalize, for example, alternative education. Candidates with only alternative education pathways post-high school \u2014 coding bootcamps or digital certifications \u2014 appeared to be penalized by recruiters in this study. However, with limited observations (n=11), it\u2019s inconclusive without further study. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-5)\n6. That field was optional, so most of the reasons recruiters provided were in cases when they said no \u2014 presumably because the reasons for saying yes may have seemed self-evident. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-6)\n7. It\u2019s not that recruiters who generally take their time make more accurate judgements. Any recruiter slowing down might make them better at judging resumes! [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-7)\n8. It\u2019s important to stress that neither algorithm was custom-built. The models, one using a Random Forest algorithm and the other an XGBoost algorithm, are distinct but interrelated approaches akin to [Decision Tree algorithms](https://medium.com/@brandon93.w/decision-tree-random-forest-and-xgboost-an-exploration-into-the-heart-of-machine-learning-90dc212f4948). Decision trees sort data into groups based on features. Random forest algorithms combine multiple decision trees to improve predictions. XGBoost builds multiple decision trees one after another, with each new tree focusing on prediction errors from the previous trees. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-8)\n9. Training data excluded data in this study. We take user privacy very seriously, and we want to stress that all models were local and anonymized and that no data in this study was shared with cloud LLMs. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-9)\n10. To see a particularly egregious example of recruiters favoring brands over substance, take a close look at [this fake resume that got a bunch of recruiter responses](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/qhg5jo/this_resume_got_me_an_interview/). [And this one too](https://twitter.com/JerryJHLee/status/1778484920593055763). [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-10)\n11. We haven\u2019t proven causality here, but when we just scoped our analysis to the same person, it appeared that taking more time did help (in other words, it\u2019s not just that recruiters who spend more time usually are more accurate; it\u2019s the added time). Still, this is something that merits more work, and we'll try to investigate it causally in the future. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-11)\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

Yes.\n\nDuring my 11 weeks, I solved an important business problem, quadrupled my problem-solving skills, and collaborated with the fantastic folks who built the product made for engineers, by engineers.\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/98_DAE_405_8387_4_A56_B342_0_E91_B1_EE_4_EE_4_cdb8f54a4c.webp)\n\nWinning all categories of the interviewing.io code golf competition\n\n## Virtual & collaborative whiteboarding is hard\n\nWhile solutions such as CoderPad have allowed companies including interviewing.io to conduct virtual interviews easily, CoderPad has one significant shortcoming: Drawing Mode.\n\nAnd companies know this too.\n\nText works fine for normal coding questions but it falls flat on its face for systems design interviews which typically involve drawing shapes and lines which might be hard to depict using text in an IDE and CoderPad\u2019s attempt at solving this problem using their Drawing Mode is lackluster. This is why companies have resorted to using Excalidraw for systems design interviews.\n\nExcalidraw is an open-source whiteboard tool and is feature-rich compared to CoderPad\u2019s drawing mode, some of its valuable features include importing user-made shapes, dark mode (yes), support for real-time user collaboration, and adaptability to different screen sizes.\n\nYou can go to excalidraw.com right now and jump into multiplayer mode and start collaborating with your peers.\n\nSo, if the solution to the CoderPad\u2019s drawing mode is just as simple as dropping a link to an Excalidraw board, then what\u2019s left, Shehbaj?\n\n## Neither CoderPad\u2019s drawing mode nor Excalidraw\u2019s self-hosted solution is replayable\n\nOne of the ways interviewing.io provides the most value to its customers is by allowing them to watch their mock interview replays, and with the rest of the world by sharing these mock interviews.\n\nExample of a systems design interview conducted via text. Imagine how many more high-quality replays we could have gotten if the Drawing Mode worked?\n\nSo by allowing customers to use CoderPad\u2019s Drawing Mode or Excalidraw\u2019s self-hosted solution, not only does interviewing.io rob their customers of a core product feature, but it also prevents interviewing.io from sharing amazing replays of systems design interviews conducted with these tools with the rest of the world.\n\nSo, to deal with all this, we made our own whiteboard! \ud83d\ude80\n\n## System overview\n\n![Diagram showing how drawing data flows from one participant to the other](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FB9_A3_ACB_7_1_AEC_4951_B89_A_C74015_B02692_000b042a79.webp&w=2048&q=75 \"Whiteboard data flow\")\n\nExcalidraw lets us embed their whiteboard in our React frontend through their npm package. With that, we set up the wiring to connect everything in the full stack together. We use WebSockets to transfer changes between the client and the server and store changes in a MongoDB document.\n\n## Features\n\nOur whiteboard supports real-time user collaboration, mobile screens, and most importantly, the ability to watch replays.\n\n### Real-time user collaboration\n\nWasn\u2019t that the whole point of making this thing???\n\n![Screencast animation showing two users collaborating on a drawing](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FColorful_Unpleasant_Iguanodon_size_restricted_41d2eff4f4.gif&w=1920&q=75 \"Real-time user collaboration in action\")\n\n### Mobile friendly\n\nCoding on a mobile screen is hard, but making beautiful drawings isn\u2019t. Now, our users can join from their tablets and other touch screen devices that will allow them to prep for their systems design interviews in style.\n\n![Screencast animation showing the whiteboard on a smaller mobile screen](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FCompassionate_Distant_Arieltoucan_size_restricted_ae0011c06c.gif%3Fupdated_at%3D2022-12-14T13%3A43%3A34.018Z&w=1080&q=75 \"Whiteboard on a smaller mobile screen\")\n\n### Replay support\n\nTo get the replay to work, we store all the elements which are added, updated, or deleted based on the timestamp of the event.\n\n```\nconst whiteboardSchema = new Schema({\n  // ...\n  \n  elements: [{\n    createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now, required: true },\n    addedElements: { type: [ExcalidrawElement], required: true }\n  }]\n  \n  // ...\n})\n\n```\n\nPseudocode of a Mongoose Schema for storing an Excalidraw Scene in MongoDB\n\nThen on the frontend, we fetch all the scene data for replay and sync the current scene with the current timestamp in the replay.\n\n```\nconst replayElements = fetch(...); // Fetch all the sceneData from the server\nconst excalidrawCanvas = useRef(...);\n\nconst syncReplay = (timestamp: number) => {\n  \n  // ...\n  \n  const currentSceneElements: Map<string, ExcalidrawElement>() = new Map();\n  \n  replayElements.forEach(replayData => {\n    if (replayData.createdAt <= timestamp) {\n      replayData.changedElements.forEach(element => {\n        currentSceneElements[element.id] = element;\n      }\n    };\n  });\n  \n  excalidrawCanvas.updateScene({ elements : currentSceneElements });\n  \n  // ...\n\n};\n\n```\n\nPseudocode for syncing the Excalidraw scene on the frontend for replay\n\nTo try out the whiteboard in production and test out the replay functionality, I did a mock systems design interview with a Senior Software Engineer (SDE III) from Amazon. We discussed how to build a feed system similar to Facebook. Here are some clips of the replay.\n\n![Screencast animation showing the whiteboard in replay mode and the use of drawing and text tools](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FUnequaled_Teeming_Brontosaurus_size_restricted_66b722e964.gif&w=1200&q=75 \"Replay mode with drawing and text tools\")\n\nScreenshot #1 - Replay mode with drawing and text tools\n\n\n\n![Screencast animation showing the whiteboard in replay mode zoomed out](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FSilver_Wellworn_Agouti_size_restricted_8a367241f7.gif&w=1200&q=75 \"Replay mode zoomed out\")\n\nScreenshot #2 - Replay mode zoomed out\n\nNot bad for a college student doing a systems design interview for the first time \ud83e\udd71\ud83e\udd71\ud83e\udd71\ud83e\udd71\ud83e\udd71\ud83e\udd71\n\n![Screenshot showing interviewer feedback on an interview where the whiteboard was put to use](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FC8938307_45_BD_4886_B7_FD_C85_B77_B47_E45_6a3d8c204e.webp&w=1080&q=75 \"Interview feedback after using the whiteboard\")\n\nThe whiteboard is now live, so go check it out and let us know if you have any feedback!!!\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

We regularly hear stories about college dropouts, who, through hard work and sheer determination, bootstrapped themselves into millionaires. These stories appeal to our sense of wonder and our desire for fairness in the world, but the reality is very different. For many students looking for their first job, the odds of breaking into a top company are slim because they will likely never even have the chance to show their skills in an interview. For these students (typically ones without a top school on their resume), their first job is often a watershed moment where success or failure can determine which opportunities will be open to them from that point forward and ultimately define the course of their entire career. In other words, having the right skills as a student is nowhere near enough to get you a job at a top-tier tech company.\n\nTo make this point concrete, **consider three** (fictitious, yet indicative) **student personas, similar in smarts and skills but attending vastly different colleges. All are seeking jobs as software engineers at top companies upon graduation**.\n\nMason goes to Harvard. He has a mediocre GPA but knows that doesn\u2019t matter to tech companies, where some of his friends already work. Come September, recent graduates and alums fly back to campus on their company\u2019s dime in order to recruit him. While enjoying a nice free meal in Harvard Square, he has the opportunity to ask these successful engineers questions about their current work. If he likes the company, all he has to do is accept the company\u2019s standing invitation to interview on campus the next morning.\n\n[Emily](https://blog.andrewhoang.me/how-to-be-emily/) is a computer science student at a mid-sized school ranked in the top 30 for computer science. She has solid coursework in algorithms under her belt, a good GPA, and experience as an engineering intern at a local bank. On the day of her campus\u2019s career fair, she works up the courage to approach companies \u2013 this will be her only chance to interact with companies where she dreams of working. Despite the tech industry being casual, the attire of this career fair is business formal with a tinge of sweaty. So after awkwardly putting together an outfit she would never wear again[1](#user-content-fn-1), she locates an ancient printer on the far side of campus and prints 50 copies of her resume. After pushing through the lines in order to line up at the booths of tech companies, she gives her resume to every single tech company at the fair over the course of several hours. She won\u2019t find out for two more weeks if she got any interviews.\n\nAnthony goes to a state school near the town where he grew up. He is top in his class, as well as a self-taught programmer, having gone above and beyond his coursework to hack together some apps. His school\u2019s career fair has a bunch of local, non-tech employers. He has no means of connecting with tech companies face-to-face and doesn\u2019t know anyone who works in tech. So, he applies to nearly a hundred tech companies indiscriminately through their website online, uploading his resume and carefully crafted cover letter. He will probably never hear from them.\n\n## Career fair mania\n\nThe status quo in university recruiting revolves around career fairs and in-person campus recruiting, which have serious limitations. For one, they are extremely expensive, especially at elite schools. Prime real estate at the MIT career fair will run you a steep $18,000, for entry alone. That\u2019s not counting the price of swag (which gets more exorbitant each year), travel, and, most importantly, the opportunity cost of attending engineers\u2019 time. **While college students command the lowest salaries, it\u2019s not uncommon for tech companies to spend 50% more on recruiting a student than a senior engineer.**\n\nAt elite schools, the lengths to which companies go to differentiate themselves is becoming more exorbitant with each passing year. In fact, students at elite colleges suffer from company overload because every major tech company, big and small, is trying to recruit them. All of this, while students at non-elite colleges are scrambling to get their foot in the door without any recruiters, let alone VPs of high-profile companies, visiting their campus.\n\nOf course, due to this cost, companies are limited in their ability to visit colleges in person, and even large companies can visit around 15 or 20 colleges at most. This strategy overlooks top students at solid CS programs that are out of physical reach.\n\nIn an effort to overcome this, companies are attending conferences and hackathons out of desperation to reach students at other colleges. The sponsorship tier for the Grace Hopper Conference, the premier gathering for women in tech, tops out at $100,000, with the sponsorship tier to get a single interview booth starting at $30,000. Additionally, larger companies send representatives (usually engineers) to large hackathons in an effort to recruit students in the midst of a 48-hour all-nighter. However, the nature of in-person career fairs and events are that not all students will be present. Grace Hopper is famously expensive to attend as a student, especially when factoring in airfare and hotel.\n\nThis cost is inefficient at best, and prohibitive at worst, especially for small startups with low budget and brand. Career fairs serve a tiny portion of companies and a tiny portion of students, and the rest are caught in the pecuniary crossfire. **Demand for talented engineers out of college who bring a different lived experience to tech has never been higher, yet companies are passing on precisely these students via traditional methods.** Confounding the issue even further is the fundamental question of [whether having attended a top school has much bearing on candidate quality](https://interviewing.io/blog/lessons-from-3000-technical-interviews) in the first place (more on that in the section on technical screening below).\n\n![Chart showing how career fairs suck](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1896f_threshold_4_f34775ee84.webp%3Fupdated_at%3D2022-11-21T19%3A55%3A16.652Z&w=1920&q=75 \"Career fairs suck\")\n\n## Homogeneity of hires\n\nThe focus of companies on elite schools has notable, negative implications for the diversity of their applicants. In particular, many schools that companies traditionally visit are notably lacking in diversity, especially when it comes to race and socioeconomic status. According to a [survey of computer science students at Stanford](https://medium.com/@jcueto/race-and-gender-among-computer-science-majors-at-stanford-3824c4062e3a), there were just fifteen Hispanic female and fifteen black female computer science majors in the 2015 graduating class *total*. In this analysis, the Stanford 2015 CS major was 9% Hispanic and 6% black. According to a [2015 analysis](https://medium.com/@winniewu/race-and-gender-among-computer-science-concentrators-at-harvard-1c1943a20457), the Harvard CS major was just 3% black and 5 percent Hispanic. Companies that are diversity-forward and constrained to recruiting at the same few schools end up competing over this small pool of diverse students. Meanwhile, there is an entire ocean of qualified, racially diverse students from less traditional backgrounds whom companies are overlooking.\n\nThe focus on elite schools also has meaningful implications on socioeconomic diversity. According to a detailed [New York Times infographic](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html?mcubz=0&_r=0), \u201cfour in 10 students from the top 0.1 percent attend an Ivy League or elite university, roughly equivalent to the share of students from poor families who attend any two- or four-year college.\u201d The infographic highlights the rigid segmentation of students by class background in college matriculation.\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Where_Todays_25_year_olds_went_to_college_b8f73e7688.webp?updated_at=2022-11-21T20:14:07.383Z)\n\n\nSource: [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html)\n\n\n\nThe article finds that the few lower-income students who end up at elite colleges do about as well as their more affluent classmates but that attending an elite versus non-elite college makes a huge difference in future income.\n\nThe focus of tech companies on elite schools lends credence to this statistic, codifying the rigidity with which students at elite college are catapulted into the 1 percent, while others are left behind. Career-wise, it\u2019s that first job or internship you get while you\u2019re still in school that can determine what opportunities you have access to in the future. And yet, students at non-elite colleges have trouble accessing these very internships and jobs, or even getting a meager first round interview, contributing to the lack of social mobility in our society not for lack of skills but for lack of connections. This sucks. A lot.\n\n## The technical screen\n\nLet\u2019s return to our three students. Let\u2019s say that Emily, the student who attended her college\u2019s career fair, gets called back by one or two companies for a first round interview if her resume meets the criteria that companies are looking for. Not having an internship at a top tech company already \u2014 quite the catch-22 \u2014 puts her at a disadvantage. Anthony has little to no chance of hearing back from employers via his applications online, but let\u2019s say that by some miracle lands a phone screen with one of the tech giants (his best shot, as there are more recruiters to look through the resume dump on the other end).\n\nWhat are their experiences when it comes to prepping for upcoming technical interviews?\n\nMason, the Harvard student, [attends an event](https://www.facebook.com/events/138642833412845/) on campus with Facebook engineers teaching him how to pass the technical interview. He also accepts a few interviews at companies he\u2019s less excited with for practice, and just in case. While he of course needs be sharp and prepare in order to get good at these sorts of algorithmic problems, he has all of the resources he could ask for and more at his disposal. Unsurprisingly, his Facebook interview goes well.\n\nEmily\u2019s school has an informal, undergraduate computer science club in which they are collectively reading technical interviewing guides and trying to figure out what tech companies want from them. She has a couple interviews lined up, but all of which are for jobs she\u2019s desperate to get. They trade tips after interviews but ultimately have a shaky understanding of they did right and wrong in the absence of post-interview feedback from companies. Only a couple of alumni from their school have made it to top tech companies in the past, and so they lack the kinds of information that Mason has on what companies are looking for. (E.g. Don\u2019t be afraid to take hints, make sure to explain your thought process, what the heck is this CoderPad thing anyway\u2026)\n\nAnthony doesn\u2019t know anyone who has a tech job like the one he\u2019s interviewing for, and only one of his friends is also interviewing. He doesn\u2019t know where to start when it comes to getting ready for his upcoming interview at GoogFaceSoft. He only has one shot at it with no practice interviews lined up. He prepares by googling \u201ctech interview questions\u201d and stumbles upon a bunch of unrealistic interview questions, many of them behavioral or outdated. He might be offered the interview and be fit for the job, but he sure doesn\u2019t know how to pass the interview.\n\nFor students who may be unfamiliar with the art of the technical interview, algorithmic interviews can be mystifying, [leading to an imbalance of information on how to succeed](https://interviewing.io/blog/you-cant-fix-diversity-in-tech-without-fixing-the-technical-interview). Given that [technical interviewing is a game](https://interviewing.io/blog/after-a-lot-more-data-technical-interview-performance-really-is-kind-of-arbitrary), it is important that everyone knows the rules, spoken and unspoken. There are many practice resources available, but no amount of reading and re-reading *Cracking the Coding Interview* can prepare you for that moment when you are suddenly in a live, technical phone screen with another human.\n\n## We built a better way to hire\n\nUltimately, as long as university hiring relies on a campus-by-campus approach, the status quo will continue to be fundamentally inefficient and unmeritocratic. No company, not even the tech giants, can cover every school or every resume submitted online. And, in the absence of any meaningful information on a student\u2019s resume, companies default to their university as the only proxy. This approach is inefficient at best and, at worst, it\u2019s the first in a series of watershed moments that derail the promise of social mobility for the non-elite, taking with them any hope of promoting diversity among computer science students.\n\nBecause this level of inequity, placed for maximum damage right at the start of people\u2019s careers, really pissed us off, we decided to do something about it. interviewing.io\u2019s answer to the unfortunate status quo is a university-specific hiring platform. If you\u2019re already familiar with how core interviewing.io works, you\u2019ll see that the premise is exactly the same. **We give out free practice to students, and use their performance in practice to identify top performers, completely independently of their pedigree. Those top performers then get to interview with companies like Lyft and Quora on our platform. In other words, we\u2019re excited to provide students with pathways into tech that don\u2019t involve going to an elite school or knowing someone on the inside.** So far, we\u2019ve been very pleased with the results. You can see our student demographics and where they\u2019re coming from below. Students from all walks of life, whether they\u2019re from MIT or a school you\u2019d never visit, are flocking to the platform, and we couldn\u2019t be prouder.\n\ninterviewing.io evaluates students based on their coding skills, not their resume. We are open to students regardless of their university affiliation, college major, and pretty much anything else (we ask for your class year to make sure you\u2019re available when companies want you and that\u2019s about it). Unlike traditional campus recruiting, we attract students organically (getting free practice with engineers from top companies is a pretty big draw) from schools big and small from across the country.\n\nWe\u2019re also proud that **almost 40 percent of our university candidates come from backgrounds that are underrepresented in tech**.\n\n![Chart showing underrepresented status of students who are using interviewing.io](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FUnderrepresented_status_of_students_on_interviewing_io_a00a8396af.webp%3Fupdated_at%3D2022-11-21T19%3A57%3A53.399Z&w=1920&q=75 \"Underrepresented status of students on interviewing.io\")\n\nBecause of our completely blind, skills-first approach, we\u2019ve seen an interesting phenomenon happen time and time again: when a student unmasks at the end of a successful interview, the company in question realizes that the student who just aced their technical phone screen was one whose resume was sitting at the bottom of the pile all along.\n\nIn addition to identifying top students who bring a different lived experience to tech, we\u2019re excited about the economics of our model. **With interviewing.io, a mid-sized startup can staff their entire intern class for the same cost as attending 1-2 career fairs at top schools\u2026 with a good chunk of those interns coming from underrepresented backgrounds.**\n\n*Meena runs interviewing.io\u2019s university hiring program. We help companies hire college students from all over the US, with a focus on diversity. Prior to joining interviewing.io, Meena was a software engineer at Clever, and before that, Meena was in college on the other side of the engineer interviewing equation.*\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1.

Here's how we do it.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: February 27, 2023; Last updated: August 26, 2023\n\ninterviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform and eng hiring marketplace. Engineers use us for mock interviews, and we use the data from those interviews to surface top performers, in a much fairer and more predictive way than a resume. If you\u2019re a top performer on interviewing.io, we fast-track you at the world\u2019s best companies.\n\nWe make money in two ways: engineers pay us for mock interviews, and employers pay us for access to the best performers. This means that we live and die by the quality of our interviewers in a way that no single employer does, no matter how much they say they care about people analytics or interviewer metrics or training. If we don\u2019t have really well-calibrated interviewers, who also create great candidate experience, we don\u2019t get paid.\n\nIn a recent post, we shared how, over time, we came up with two metrics that, together, tell a complete and compelling story about interviewer quality[: the candidate experience metric and the calibration metric](https://interviewing.io/blog/our-business-depends-on-having-the-best-interviewers-so-we-built-an-interviewer-rating-system-and-you-can-too). In this post, we\u2019ll talk about how to apply our learnings about interviewer quality to your own process. We\u2019ve made a bunch of mistakes so you don\u2019t have to!\n\nBut first, a pessimistic word. The more time I spend in this industry, the more I\u2019m convinced that many top companies end up hiring great engineers not because of their process but despite it. The reality is that top companies are generally not incentivized to care about candidate experience or metrics. As long as you have a revolving door of candidates, both can be pretty meh, and if you\u2019re just a little bit better on calibration than a coin flip and not bad enough to outright scare people away, you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nIn the rare instances where I\u2019ve seen companies really care about interviewer quality, it\u2019s because an eng leader there has taken it upon themselves, as a labor of love. Otherwise, if we\u2019re pragmatic about it, hiring is a cost center, and it\u2019s never going to get the attention that a profit center will. At the same time, some of you reading this post will care enough about interviewer quality and candidate experience to make some changes within your organization.\n\nOn the back of that fervent hope, below is a punch list of things you can do to move the needle:\n\n1. Choose the people who are passionate about interviewing to conduct your interviews, and don\u2019t force the others\n2. Track metrics\n3. Make being a good interviewer part of your culture, and reward it explicitly (i.e., create the right incentive structure)\n4. Make a point of delivering constructive feedback after each interview\n\n## Choose the people who are passionate about interviewing to conduct your interviews, and don\u2019t force the others\n\nLook, the reality is that conducting interviews is a polarizing task \u2014 people either are *passionate* (so passionate that I put it in italics) about it, or they despise it. Speculating on what perfect storm of past experiences, heredity, and political leanings will make an interviewer fall into one camp or the other is outside the scope of this post. However, after personally interviewing hundreds of interviewers, I am 100% convinced that conducting interviews is polarizing.\n\nWhat does this mean for you? Choose the people who are *passionate* about interviewing to conduct your interviews. It\u2019s easy to figure out who they are. Just ask them. Over the years, I\u2019ve listened to a lot of interview replays. You can immediately identify when an interviewer is checked out. It\u2019s painful. You\u2019ll hear them typing. You\u2019ll hear them go silent for a while. You certainly won\u2019t hear them collaborating with their candidate or gently guiding them away from a perilous rabbit hole. Compare that to a good experience [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhzF81xV1so) [1](#user-content-fn-1). We\u2019ve all been on the receiving end of an interviewer\u2019s callous indifference, but it\u2019s absolutely preventable. *If someone hates conducting interviews, don\u2019t make them.*\n\nIn our experience, a terrible question in the hands of a skilled, engaged interviewer can become great & carry lots of signal. A great question asked by an unskilled, disconnected interviewer will always be bad\u2026 like so:\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/resize_b152080cc8.png)\n\nIf you want to be deliberate about choosing your best interviewers, follow the [best practices we've found after sifting through thousands of interview recordings](https://interviewing.io/blog/best-technical-interviews-common). The best interviewers see every interview as a collaborative exercise with the goal of seeing if they can \u201cbe smart together\". The data shows that engagement really does matter.\n\n## Track metrics\n\nFirst, please take a look at our [post about the 2 metrics we track](https://interviewing.io/blog/our-business-depends-on-having-the-best-interviewers-so-we-built-an-interviewer-rating-system-and-you-can-too) \u2013 the candidate experience score and the calibration score \u2013 if you haven\u2019t already. Why track metrics in the first place? There\u2019s an old adage that says you can\u2019t fix what you can\u2019t measure. I think this expression is overused \u2014 sometimes intuition is good enough.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t work for interviews though \u2014 most of the time, an interview is a private interaction between two people, so an independent observer can\u2019t acquire the anecdotal intuition to form opinions. Things are regularly happening, but unless you measure them, they\u2019re likely happening in a vacuum. Yes, you might do some reverse shadows when training a new interviewer, but once they\u2019re on their own, things tend to go sideways.\n\nThe second reason intuition isn\u2019t good enough here is that you\u2019re often not privy to interview outcomes, either because there\u2019s a latency to them or because the candidate isn\u2019t interviewing for your team\u2026 or because if you reject someone at the phone screen stage, you don\u2019t get to find out if they were a false negative.\n\nUnfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, no single company can reproduce the kind of data we have, either about candidate experience or about outcomes. For candidate experience, candidates don\u2019t usually give post-interview feedback in the wild, and when they do, because the interviews aren\u2019t anonymous and the candidate wants to work there, they\u2019re not going to say bad things. And for outcomes, though you\u2019ll know if someone passed an onsite, it\u2019s just one data point for that person (e.g., you don\u2019t know how they did in their interviews at other companies, and you typically won\u2019t know what ended up happening to people you rejected).\n\nHere\u2019s what you can do despite these limitations:\n\n1. Send candidates (truly) anonymous surveys AFTER the interview process is over. Ask about question quality, interviewer engagement, whether they\u2019d want to be on a team with their interviewer, and so on.\n2. Make a point of checking the LinkedIn of candidates you reject to see where they ended up. This will give you a decent proxy for what portion of your candidates you wrongfully rejected.\n3. Determine how well calibrated your interviewers are by identifying [superforecasters](https://interviewing.io/blog/technical-phone-screen-superforecasters), i.e., track the onsite pass rate for all the candidates interviewed by a given interviewer.\n\nOnce you do these three things (or even if you do the first one and just one of the other two), you\u2019ll be able to create a \u201ccandidate experience score\u201d and an \u201caccuracy score\u201d for each interviewer. Track these scores over time, and use them to inform interview scheduling frequency and assignment.\n\n## Create the right incentive structure\n\nWe just talked about metrics. The right incentive structure gives your metrics teeth.\n\nEvery month, we run an onboarding session for all of our new interviewers where we talk about our standards, our business model, the metrics we track, and why they matter.\n\nDuring these onboarding sessions, we hear one thing over and over from new interviewers \u2014 how much better the experience of being an interviewer is when they\u2019re paid for their time. If you read that sentence again, you might find it somewhat ironic. After all, these are people who conduct interviews day in and day out at their jobs, where they are literally being paid for their time.\n\nUnfortunately, even though that\u2019s technically true, engineers don\u2019t really feel like they\u2019re being paid to do interviews because it\u2019s so perfunctory. There\u2019s no reward for doing a good job and, usually, no punishment for doing a bad job \u2014 it\u2019s just something you have to do. Worse, at most companies, conducting interviews is an unwelcome distraction from doing real work (i.e., shipping product), and the interviewers who are passionate about doing a good job do it despite their incentive structure and not because of it.\n\nThis is simple to fix. Outside of using the two aforementioned metrics to inform who gets booked and how often, you can take it a step further and actually reward being a good interviewer.\n\nIf you use OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), make staying above a certain candidate experience score one of those OKRs and achieving a certain accuracy score another one.\n\nAlternatively (or additionally), institute a cash bonus for conducting interviews while maintaining good ratings.\n\nWhen establishing criteria for promotions, ensure that no one can become a people manager without being a stellar interviewer \u2014 I don\u2019t think I have to convince you that those skill sets overlap.\n\n## Make a point of delivering constructive feedback after each interview\n\nI know this is a big ask, but trust me, it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nYour legal department will probably tell you not to do it, but we did the research, and literally [zero companies (at least in the US) have ever been sued by an engineer](https://interviewing.io/blog/no-engineer-has-ever-sued-a-company-because-of-constructive-post-interview-feedback-so-why-dont-employers-do-it) who received post-interview feedback.\n\nIn cases where the candidate performed well, our data shows that [delivering feedback will increase their odds of ultimately accepting your offer](https://interviewing.io/blog/people-cant-gauge-their-own-interview-performance-and-that-makes-them-harder-to-hire). The hard part, of course, is delivering feedback when the interview goes poorly. No one wants to deal with an angry, defensive candidate, even if they\u2019re not worried about the candidate\u2019s litigiousness.\n\nWhile post-interview feedback is baked into interviewing.io, it\u2019s not something that really happens in the wild, so we had to invent our own best practices for how to do it. Below is a slide taken verbatim from our monthly interviewer onboarding sessions. I hope that sharing it encourages a few of you to try this out. The most important takeaway from this slide is to not focus on the outcome but rather to get specific right away \u2014 this will keep your candidate from getting defensive and will set them up to actually hear and internalize your feedback.\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/delivering_honest_feedback_synchronously_6d5c927a30.png)\n\nIf you do decide to give post-interview feedback, you can also check out our [detailed playbook for exactly how to do it](https://interviewing.io/blog/why-giving-feedback-good-or-bad-will-help-you-hire) (it\u2019s a much more detailed version of the slide pictured above).\n\nWe have no delusions that you\u2019ll do most of these things. But even if you do a few, you will stand out, your candidates will remember you, and you will feel great about having helped someone. Years ago, back when I was head of recruiting at a startup, because I was a rare breed of recruiter who had also been an engineer, I also conducted technical interviews. In some ways, this setup gave me more freedom because I was the one that had to deal with candidates, end to end \u2013 when I took risks, I was only creating problems for myself.\n\nAt some point, I started giving candidates verbal feedback after their interviews, especially in cases where it was close and where the candidate would benefit from a nudge in the right direction (\u201cHey, make sure you get comfortable with manipulating hash tables.\u201d) Then I took it a step further and started sending them a book.\n\nYears later, many of those users who had failed their technical interview with me became interviewing.io\u2019s first customers.\n\nSo, yeah, if you do any of these things, you generate a lot of good will, and accrued good will over time can make all the difference between a stellar employer brand and a mediocre one. It can also help you edge out companies who pay more or have flashier brands but don\u2019t care about making interviewing better.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. We also have replays of shitty interviews. That\u2019s what made us come up with our metric, but I won\u2019t share them to protect the guilty.

It can take upwards of 100 engineering hours to hire a single candidate, and we had over 50 engineers to hire. Even with the majority of the team chipping in, engineers would often spend multiple hours a week in interviews. Folks began to complain about interview burnout. Also, fewer people were actually getting offers; the onsite pass rate had fallen by almost a third, from ~40% to under 30%. This meant we needed even more interviews for every hire. Visnu and I were early engineers bothered most by the state of our hiring process. We dug in. Within a few months, the onsite pass rate went back up, and interviewing burnout receded.

We looked at 100K interviews to find out.\n\nBy Dima Korolev | Published: May 17, 2022; Last updated: May 1, 2023\n\n*Hey, Aline (founder of interviewing.io) here. This is the 5th post in our Guest Author series.*\n\n*One of the things I\u2019m most excited about with the Guest Author series is the diversity of opinions it\u2019s bringing to our blog. Technical interviewing and hiring is fraught with controversy, and not everything these posts contain will be in line with my personal opinions or the official opinions of interviewing.io. But that\u2019s what\u2019s great about it. After over a decade in this business, I still don\u2019t think there\u2019s a right way to conduct interviews, and I think hiring is always going to be a bit of a mess because it\u2019s a fundamentally human process. Even if we don\u2019t always agree, I do promise that the content we put forth will be curated, high quality, and written by smart people who are passionate about this space.*\n\n*If you have strong opinions about interviewing or hiring that you\u2019ve been itching to write about, we\u2019d love to hear from you. Please email me at [aline@interviewing.io](mailto:aline@interviewing.io).*\n\n![Author avatar](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FDima_Korolev_61fbf691c1.png&w=384&q=75 \"Dima Korolev\")\n\nDima Korolev\n\nDima Korolev finds joy in helping established companies on a large-scale architecture level, previously at PokerStars, now at Miro. His career includes roles at Google (from 2007\u20132011), along with other large companies and several successful startups. While in school, Dima once earned Coder of the Month and was consistently in the top 100 globally on Topcoder. He particularly enjoys mentoring engineers and finds it emotionally rewarding to help others develop stronger skills and expand their horizons. His love of helping others inspired Dima to become one of the first interviewers on interviewing.io, completing more than 100 interviews to date. You can reach him on [*LinkedIn*](http://www.linkedin.com/in/dimakorolev)*,* [*GitHub*](https://github.com/dkorolev)*,* [*Twitter*](https://twitter.com/UniqueDima)*,* and his [*website*](http://dima.ai/).\n\nThe interviewing.io platform has hosted and collected feedback from over 100K technical interviews, split between mock interviews and real ones. It\u2019s generally accepted that to pass a technical interview, you have to not only come up with a solution to the problem (or at least make good headway), but you also have to do a good job of articulating your thoughts, explaining to your interviewer what you\u2019re doing as you\u2019re doing it, and coherently discussing tradeoffs and concepts like time and space complexity.\n\nBut how important is communication in technical interviews, really? We looked at the data, and it turns out that *talk is cheap*. Read on to find out how and why.\n\n## The setup\n\nOn interviewing.io, engineers can practice technical interviewing anonymously. When an interviewer and an interviewee match on interviewing.io, they join a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard, and jump right into a technical interview. After each interview, both parties leave feedback, and once they\u2019ve both submitted, each one can see what the other person said and how they were rated.\n\nHere\u2019s the feedback form that interviewers fill out:\n\n![Sample interview feedback form](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5a595_screenshot_2017_11_29_09_13_30_1ca42f5eec.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Interview feedback form\")\n\nAs you can see above, there\u2019s one yes/no question: *Would you advance this person to the next round?* There are also three other questions, each graded on a scale from 1 to 4 (4 is best):\n\n- Technical ability, which we\u2019ll call ***Code***\n- Problem-solving ability, which we\u2019ll call ***Solve***\n- Communication skill, which we\u2019ll call ***Communicate***\n\nDo the numeric scores predict whether a candidate gets advanced to the next round? You bet! Here are the top buckets, ranked by how often the interviewers say \u201cyes\u201d:\n\n![Success-Rate.png](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Success_Rate_f6934e5141.png)\n\nRight away, three pieces of anecdotal evidence suggest that talk is cheap:\n\n1. The only \u201c2\u201d that made it to the list is communication score (see 4-4-2 above).\n2. The least valuable \u201c4\u201d coupled with two \u201c3\u201d-s is also the communication score (see 3-3-4 above), with a major drop in hire rate.\n3. And, ironically, 4-3-3, a scenario where the candidate got 3s in both communication and problem solving, has a [negligibly] higher success rate than 4-3-4, a scenario where the candidate got a 4 in communication and a 3 in problem solving!\n\nIn fact, the 4-4-2 bucket is the third best one can get, losing only to 4-4-4 and 4-4-3. Interviewers are happy to advance 4-4-2 candidates to the onsite round a whopping 96% of the time. Notably, a candidate is 3X more likely to get rejected with 3-3-4 than with 4-4-2.\n\nSo it seems that talk is cheap. But to learn exactly *how* cheap, we have to go deeper, and this is where data science helps.\n\n## Into the data\n\nIt\u2019s data science time! Let\u2019s do a thought experiment. Imagine a candidate walks into an interview, impaired by the moral equivalent of 1 point, on either their ability to Code, to Solve, or to Communicate.[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n\nTo minimize damage, from which ability should our imaginary candidate have that 1 point deducted?\n\nTo answer this question, let\u2019s take a look at how much worse this rejection rate would be with a 1-point deduction.\n\n![Rejection-with-minus.png](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Rejection_with_minus_804e06854a.png)\n\nWhoa!\n\nFor a good third of all interviews, **dropping 1 point from the *Code* or *Solve* scores would lead to the rejection rate skyrocketing 6X**! Clearly, that last point in *Code* or *Solve* is extremely valuable.\n\nAt the same time, in all categories, the negative impact of dropping 1 point from the *Communicate* category is by far the smallest.\n\nThe opposite direction is interesting as well. Say our imaginary candidate is fond of Heroes of Might and Magic and was up all night playing. *This is not recommended either, but imaginary experiments really help with science.* Just before the interview, this candidate meditates, their inner interviewee hero visits a Temple, and their Morale improves by 1. They now have a +1 score point. How should our hero best use it? The rejection rate would now decrease with the score increasing. Hence it\u2019s green in the table.\n\n![Rejection-with-plus.png](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Rejection_with_plus_30cde165c3.png)\n\nThe TL;DR is that +1 to *Code* and +1 to *Solve* have comparable effects, and their effect is always significantly higher than the effect of +1 to *Communicate*.\n\nThe \u201ctop 25%\u201d row is not very representative, as the 4s can not improve, and plenty of scores there already are the 4s.\n\nFor other rows, boosting *Communicate* by 1 turns out to barely affect the rejection rate. Boosting *Code* and/or *Solve*, on the other hand, can help flip up to 4 of 10 negative outcomes!\n\n## Pragmatically speaking\n\nUnfortunately, in real life we don\u2019t have magic potions that +1 your interview performance. But we do have considerable control over selecting which score to improve. Of course, 4-4-4 is the holy grail, but during an interview it is often up to you to decide which score to focus on.\n\nHere is a more realistic example. What if you could trade one score for another?\n\nAgain, the table shows the difference in rejection rates, the numbers in red are bad, and the numbers in green are good. The top row is removed because, as mentioned earlier, it is not representative.\n\n![Rejection-with-swap.png](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Rejection_with_swap_398980dc53.png)\n\nNothing could be more clear. When in doubt, **trade *Communicate* for *Solve* or *Code*.** Period.\n\n## Conclusions, and why communication still matters\n\nThe bottom line: If your objective is to get a \u201cyes,\u201d it is far less damaging to score 1 rating point lower on *Communicate*, and it is much more beneficial to score 1 rating point higher on *Code* and/or on *Solve*. Talk is indeed cheap, and indeed, coding and problem solving is what you need to show in a coding interview.\n\nKeep in mind that, obviously, these insights are valid for coding interviews. In behavioral interviews, the technical skill signal is the least valuable, while problem solving is king. And in systems design interviews, extra points on communication skills, while still the least valuable of three, are not worth exchanging for additional points in tech and problem-solving skills.\n\nIt is worth noting that practice coding interviews, while highly useful, are not 100% representative of real-life interviews. A real-life interview, even if explicitly focused on coding, is a mixture of everything.\n\n**The more senior the position, the more vital systems design and behavioral skills become. This statement is harder to prove with data, but every interviewer I spoke with agrees\u2014at least within the standard L3 to L6 range, from a junior to staff.**\n\nThus, we can conclude that:\n\n- For L3 and L4, you are better off ignoring the communication score entirely, *as long as you are consistently scoring 2+ on it*.\n- For L5+ interviews, where communication skills are far more important, standard coding practice sessions are not the best way to improve on them. Systems design practice, as well as the behavioral interviews, are there to help.\n\nGood luck, and have fun on interviewing.io!\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. Of course, it\u2019s best to postpone the interview in such a situation\u2014or even if you\u2019re just feeling unprepared. Seriously, official advice endorsed by the interviewing.io team here: Do not take your interviews when you\u2019re not in the best shape. Those companies can wait, and in our experience, recruiters are very supportive of you taking the time you need to prepare and put your best foot forward.

One of the most useful pieces of data in the current climate is the ever-changing technical interview bar \u2013 throughout 2022, it\u2019s gotten progressively harder to pass technical interviews, and it\u2019s only going to keep getting harder\u2026 because employers are gaining more leverage in the market.\n\nOne might say that because we\u2019re a mock interview platform, publishing this post is self-serving. The reality is that we take no joy in this content. Ever since hiring freezes and layoffs have started dominating the news cycle, we\u2019ve lost about half of our interview volume, many of the prominent employers who were hiring through us as recently as Q2 of this year have paused. So, trust us, we\u2019d much rather be writing about something else while living in a hiring boom. And look, whether we want to see it or not or whether we have vested interest in publishing it or not, the data is the data, and the data doesn\u2019t care. Realistically, neither will the employers who are still interviewing and hiring.\n\nWe hope that what we\u2019re about to share will help you enter an increasingly unforgiving labor market, the likes of which engineers haven\u2019t seen since the early 2000s, with your eyes wide open.\n\n## The state of the world\n\nDespite not wanting to believe it (as Upton Sinclair said, \u201cIt is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.\u201d), I\u2019m coming around to the idea that engineers are going to lose significant leverage in the market.\n\n![Chart showing the number of jobs is shrinking and the number of unemployed engineers is growing](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FTech_jobs_are_shrinking_and_the_number_of_unemployed_engineers_is_growing_1_50a288a21d.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Chart: Jobs are shrinking, and the number of unemployed engineers is growing\")\n\nIn the graph above, the blue line is the number of open tech jobs, according to [TrueUp](https://trueup.io). TrueUp is a tech job index and layoff tracker, started by [Amit Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amittaylor/). One of its limitations is that it tracks jobs at somewhat arbitrarily defined \u201ctech\u201d companies and excludes jobs (even if they\u2019re technical) at non-tech companies (e.g. Walmart\u2026 their example, not ours). However, it\u2019s the best aggregation of open jobs over time that I\u2019ve been able to find, and I think it\u2019s as good a proxy as any.\n\nThe red line comes from our [own analysis of tech layoffs](https://interviewing.io/blog/2022-layoffs-engineers-vs-other-departments) (it\u2019s on its own axis because the blue line represents the number of open tech jobs across all disciplines, whereas the red line is engineers only). We recently looked at layoff lists on layoffs.fyi, tagged them by function, and did some corrections for how likely people in different functions were to opt in to those lists. We ultimately learned that engineers comprised about 5% of total layoffs overall (though eng departments were hit harder than we expected, and at companies that did layoffs, about 12% of the eng team was let go). As such, we counted up total layoffs in the US by month and took 5% of that.\n\n**TL;DR The number of open jobs is shrinking, and the number of unemployed engineers is growing.**\n\nHow much will this actually affect hiring practices and how high the bar will actually get?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say, and I\u2019m not an economist, but I do run an eng hiring marketplace, and we have some proprietary data I\u2019d like to share with you all.\n\n## The rising eng bar\n\ninterviewing.io is both a mock interview platform and an eng hiring marketplace \u2013 engineers use us for [technical interview practice](https://interviewing.io/mocks), and top performers get fast-tracked at companies.\n\nCompanies can actually interview our top performers anonymously, right on our platform, and leave feedback after each interview. If the candidate passes, they unmask and move to the next step (typically an onsite). Feedback is both quantitative and qualitative, and in addition to telling us if the candidate passed, companies also rate them on technical ability, communication ability, and problem solving ability. Technical ability is the most predictive and is therefore weighed the most heavily in our scoring system.\n\nWhile we\u2019re not contractually allowed to list publicly which companies hire through us, it\u2019s historically been a mix of FAANGs, FAANG-adjacent top tier companies (e.g. ride sharing, file sharing), and up and coming startups. That is to say that we\u2019re confident that our data about the eng bar is indeed representative of what\u2019s happening at the top end of the market.\n\nTo figure out where the bar is and how it\u2019s changed, we averaged the technical scores for successful interviews among senior engineers[1](#user-content-fn-1) over the last few quarters and graphed it against trueup.io\u2019s number of open tech jobs (same as the blue line in the graph above). Below, you can see the results. The shape of the 2 curves surprised us in its uncanniness. **Since January of 2022, after a brief rise in Q2, tech jobs have contracted by 40%. At the same time, after a brief dip in Q2, the bar for a successful technical interview has increased by 10 percentile points (or by about 15%).[2](#user-content-fn-2)**\n\n![The engineering bar keeps rising, as the number of open tech jobs shrinks](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FThe_engineering_bar_keeps_rising_as_the_number_of_open_tech_jobs_shrinks_1_01da313f30.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Chart: Engineering bar keeps rising; as the number of open tech jobs shrinks\")\n\n## The interviewing.io technical interview bar index\n\nHere\u2019s our quantification of where the \u201ceng bar\u201d is. We\u2019ll call it the **interviewing.io technical interview bar index** (ITIB index). We used historical data to measure the link between the number of open tech jobs and the typical performance of people who cleared a real technical interview on our platform. As the plot above shows, it\u2019s a negative relationship: when the job pool shrinks, candidates have to perform better in technical interviews.\n\n**Our regression estimates show that for every 50K drop in tech jobs, candidates need to perform about 3 percentiles higher in interviews.** Given the almost halving of jobs that has happened so far in 2022, candidates went from needing to beat about two thirds of candidates who had also gotten to the phone screen stage to needing to beat more than three quarters.\n\nOne caveat to this approach is that interviewing.io probably doesn\u2019t represent the whole eng market for 2 reasons: selection bias among employers and selection bias among candidates. As I mentioned earlier, the employers who hire through us tend to have a high bar and conduct a specific kind of interview (typically algorithmic in the phone screen). Moreover, only people who do really well in mock interviews get to the point where they can talk to real companies, so these percentiles are comparing people who are already very strong performers to one another rather than to everyone in the pool. **However, because they\u2019re relative rather than absolute, we feel reasonably confident that these numbers can be generalized to the overall hiring market.**\n\nThe ITIB index captures this in a single number, measuring the current technical bar in percentile terms. If it\u2019s at 40, you need to be better than 40% of engineers to get a Yes. **Right now, it\u2019s at 78, up from 68 in Q1 of 2022.**\n\nWe\u2019ll be tracking this index on a monthly basis on Twitter. Follow us at [@interviewingio](https://twitter.com/interviewingio).\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. We just looked at senior engineers here because our average user is senior (~7 years of experience), and so that\u2019s where we have the most consistent data. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n2. In the graph called, \u201cThe eng bar keeps rising\u2026\u201d, we chose to show raw scores rather than percentiles so that our users could benchmark their scores easily. However, because our raw scores likely don\u2019t mean anything to the general public, we recomputed them as percentiles for the technical interview bar index. Also note that if you try to compute the % difference from the raw scores, you\u2019ll get a lower number, but that\u2019s not the right way to approach it because small differences in code scores amount to big differences in engineer ranking.

Pick your poison.*\n\n---\n\n**EDIT**: This post is based on stories from users who were interviewing for E4-E6 SWE and MLE roles at Meta. Other, more specialized roles may have different processes than what's described here.\n\n**EDIT 2**: As of Q1 2025, it looks like Meta is sometimes foregoing team matching in favor of driving candidates to their Monetization org (which apparently has a lot of open headcount). If this happens to you, after you pass the hiring committee, instead of entering team matching, your recruiter will tell you that you\u2019ve been assigned to this particular org and, if you proceed, you\u2019ll just get an offer. You won\u2019t get to talk to your future manager, and you\u2019ll find out team details a week after you join. From what we know, it\u2019s possible to insist on team matching instead, with the downside that it\u2019ll take an unknown amount of time rather than certainty.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to use your Meta offer primarily as leverage with other companies, this is a great thing because you\u2019ll get numbers quickly. If you\u2019re seriously interested in Meta, then this could be good or bad and depends where you are in the process and how much you want to work on monetization versus other things/how much you want to meet your manager before you work for them.\n\nSo if you\u2019re seriously interested in Meta, whether this is good or bad depends on where you are in the process. If you need them to move quickly, it\u2019s great because you know you won\u2019t be stuck in team matching. However, if you need them to slow down because you aren\u2019t as far along with other companies or because you want to work in a different org, you may want to ask your recruiter to stick with the old team matching process. In our experience, it\u2019s ok to ask this. Your recruiter may not tell you outright that that\u2019s an option, but if you ask, they will probably do it. Of course, you may be stuck longer than you want. But at least then you will have more of a say in what you work on.\n\n---\n\nAt interviewing.io, one of the services we offer our users is salary negotiation. Even though I\u2019m the founder, I still do many of the sessions myself because they give me an invaluable insider\u2019s perspective on what\u2019s actually going on in the engineering market, what different companies\u2019 offers look like, how companies extend offers, what kinds of deadlines they give, and how much they go up in compensation, under what circumstances.\n\nAccess to this kind of data is great because it helps me make better business decisions. But sometimes I see questionable patterns of behavior among companies. Recently, I\u2019ve observed a string of practices at Meta that I find reprehensible, and that\u2019s what this post is about. I\u2019ve seen the same practices with enough candidates, and across enough different titles and positions, that it\u2019s become clear to me that they are not isolated incidents or a rogue recruiter\u2019s doing but rather a consistent implementation of a deliberate strategy that comes from the top.\n\nI\u2019m writing about this for two reasons. First, if you\u2019re negotiating with Meta, you need to know how they operate and understand the unwritten rules of the game. If you do not know the rules, you will fail \u2014 long before you even start negotiating.\n\nSecond, I\u2019m hoping that someone at Meta sees this post and that maybe it\u2019ll spark an internal discussion about changing the rules.\n\n*By the way, if I\u2019m wrong, I will gladly issue a retraction and a public apology. Please contact me if you\u2019re a recruiter at Meta and find something incorrect in this post. My email is [aline@interviewing.io](mailto:aline@interviewing.io).*\n\nLastly, if you\u2019re about to interview there or are interviewing there already, please [read our free, long-form guide to their interview process and questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/meta-facebook#meta).\n\n## Meta basically has a monopoly on FAANG hiring right now\n\nI mentioned above that we do salary negotiation, but our main business is mock interviews. We offer anonymous mock interviews in the style of a bunch of different companies (mostly FAANGs). This means we know how many people are practicing for interviews at Google vs. Meta vs. other FAANGs, and that lets us guess (pretty accurately) how much hiring is actually happening at these companies.\n\nYou can read in way more detail about how all the FAANGs are doing in our [recent blog post where we made 2024 predictions](https://interviewing.io/blog/when-is-hiring-coming-back-predictions-for-2024) based on our proprietary data. But while I was writing that post, I noticed something odd. Meta was hiring way more engineers than any of the other FAANGs. In fact, Meta hiring is up more than 10X since January of last year.\n![Mock interview purchases for FAANG companies on interviewing.io (as a proxy for hiring volume) in 2023](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Mock_interview_purchases_for_FAANG_companies_on_interviewing_io_as_a_proxy_for_hiring_volume_in_2023_c7dbe9a6d7.png)\nYou can see that more recently Amazon has picked up a bit, but it\u2019s very recent and not enough to drive major change in other companies\u2019 behaviors (at least not yet). And, yes, Netflix is hiring too, but Meta\u2019s eng team is more than 10X the size of Netflix\u2019s, so in the absolute, Netflix\u2019s hiring volume isn\u2019t enough to balance Meta out. For all intents and purposes, Meta\u2019s the only FAANG that\u2019s really hiring at scale \u2014 and they\u2019re currently getting away with treating candidates really poorly as a result.\n\n## How Meta negotiates, given their effective monopoly on eng hiring\n\nHere\u2019s how Meta runs their hiring process. These practices have been consistent across every negotiation client we\u2019ve had in the past 6 months or so.\n\nMeta\u2019s hiring is centralized, which means that you enter one big interview process that\u2019s completely divorced from which team you might end up on and you interview with people whom you might never work with again. If you do well, there will be a team matching component after you pass the onsite but before you get an offer[1](#user-content-fn-1). With that in mind, here\u2019s how they run their process, once you get the green light.\n\n1. **Team matching**. This can take days or weeks, depending on how many teams you speak to and how many conversations you have with the people on each team. You'll speak with hiring managers to gauge fit and chemistry, and if you\u2019d like, you can also talk to peers. We've heard that sometimes you get the chance to talk to a handful of teams, and sometimes it's over 10. After your team-matching conversations, your recruiter will ask you to choose a team. In order to move forward, both you and the hiring manager have to opt in[2](#user-content-fn-2).\n2. **Likely down-level you**. Sometime during team matching, you\u2019ll probably find out that you\u2019ve been down-leveled. Often, your recruiter will cite your performance in the system design portion (and sometimes the behavioral portion). According to a recent survey we did, something like 55% of Meta candidates get down-leveled (more likely for generalist SWE roles, less likely for more niche roles like ML).\n3. **Make a lowball offer with just a few days to make a decision**. Once you\u2019re done with team matching, things get dicey. Your recruiter will make you a lowball offer that\u2019s often $50k or more (!!) below the average TC on levels.fyi. Moreover, you usually just get a couple of days to make a decision. If you were down-leveled, your lowball offer may include a small signing bonus as a consolation prize.\n4. **Refuse to negotiate unless you can show them other offers from comparable companies**. Your recruiter will say something like, \u201cIf you\u2019d like to increase your offer, I can take this to the compensation committee, but I need a compelling reason [i.e., another offer].\"\n5. **If you have other offers, they will apologize for the lowball offer, citing that it\u2019s \u201cautomatic numbers from our computer\u201d and raise the numbers by $100K or more (in first year\u2019s TC)**. If you do not, you will be stuck with a lowball offer, though you may be able to negotiate a small signing bonus if the offer didn\u2019t come with one already.\n\n## How to negotiate with Meta\n\nBelow are the steps for negotiating with Meta in a hard climate where they have a monopoly on hiring. We hope that most of these won\u2019t be necessary in the future. They are:\n\n- Don\u2019t share anything with your recruiter\n- Make sure you have other offers\n- Slow-play team matching\n- Build rapport with every hiring manager you talk to\n- Actually negotiate (this is the easy part)\n\n### Don\u2019t share anything with your recruiter\n\nWe wrote a whole post about how to avoid sharing information with your recruiter and why this is so vital. If you share where you\u2019re interviewing or how far along you are, or if you start negotiating prematurely, the strategies below won\u2019t work.\n\nPlease [read our post on not shooting yourself in the foot during negotiations](https://interviewing.io/blog/sabotage-salary-negotiation-before-even-start) before you continue!\n\nYou should also be aware of a few tricks specific to Meta recruiters. If you're not forthcoming about where else you're interviewing, they may say a few sneaky things.\n\nFirst, they may say something like, \"Well, we just want to know where you're interviewing so we can intro you to others who interviewed at those companies but ultimately chose Meta.\" Don't fall for that early in the process. It's a trap to get information out of you. You can always ask for those intros later, when you're negotiating and it's the right time information about your other offers.\n\nThe other thing they do is fish, saying something like, \"Well, in case you're interviewing at {Google, Netflix, some other big company they don't want to lose candidates to}, just so you know, they move kind of slowly, so we may not be able to wait.\" There, the Meta recruiter's goal is to get you to say, \"Oh, no, don't worry, I'm not interviewing at Google!\"\n\nNow, you've lost leverage in their eyes because that's one less competitive company they might lose you to... and they'll be more confident about lowballing you later on.\n\n### Make sure you have other offers\n\nAs you may have guessed from reading the previous section, it\u2019s critical to have other offers, and not just any offers but ones from top-tier companies who pay very competitively[3](#user-content-fn-3).\n\nWe realize that saying \u201chave other offers\u201d doesn\u2019t capture the blood, sweat, and tears that go into months of interview prep, applications, emails, recruiter calls, and interviews. We know it\u2019s hard, but as you\u2019ll see, it makes a huge difference in your compensation.\n\nGetting those offers doesn\u2019t start when you\u2019ve received your Meta offer. It starts months before. Make sure that you get enough initial conversations with other FAANGs, FAANG-adjacent companies, and late-stage sexy startups to end up with at least one other offer, ideally at least two. Depending on your interview performance, this might be anywhere from 4 to 10 initial conversations.[4](#user-content-fn-4)\n\n### Slow-play team matching\n\nHaving your offers come in around the same time is critical for [any negotiation](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter), but it\u2019s especially important with Meta because they take such a hard line \u2014 without other offers, they will not meaningfully budge.\n\nObviously, you\u2019ll want to start your conversations with other companies well in advance of your Meta interviews and do everything you can to make sure they all come in at the same time. However, even with your best efforts, it\u2019s not guaranteed that your timing will match up. **Here\u2019s how to make sure that your offers come in at the same time: slow-play Meta\u2019s team-matching process**.\n\nTeam matching is actually the part of your Meta journey where you have the most leverage and power. Why leverage? At this point, they know they want you, but they can\u2019t yet hold an offer deadline over you. We\u2019ve already mentioned that once they make the offer, your recruiter is going to push very hard to have you accept, often giving you a deadline of something like two days. In your recruiter\u2019s eyes, you\u2019re a ticking time bomb, where for every day you don\u2019t sign, the deal loses momentum, and your odds of signing drop off. Recruiters are also evaluated on how many candidates they close, so it\u2019s in their interest to create a false sense of scarcity in order to rush you and to use high-pressure sales tactics to get you to seal the deal.\n\nAnd what power do you have? It turns out you can really control how long team matching takes, within reason. If you\u2019re still wrapping phone screens with other companies, slow-playing is the best thing you can do. Here\u2019s how to do it.\n\n**We\u2019ve recently heard that Meta is now insisting that hiring manager conversations happen in series, but even if Meta lets you talk to multiple hiring managers concurrently, try to serialize those conversations as much as possible**. For instance, if you hear from your recruiter that you\u2019re going to start team matching on a Monday, and they offer to set up some calls for Wednesday, ask to do the first call on a Friday and the next call the following Tuesday.\nWhen we advise our users to do this, we often get pushback because they\u2019re worried that slowing things down will make them look disinterested/not serious. We promise you that\u2019s not the case. The biggest risk you run when you slow-play team matching scheduling like this is losing the chance to work on a specific team. If you find that your recruiter has proposed what seems like the perfect team for you, you can and should prioritize doing that call as soon as possible.\n\n**In addition to serializing your hiring manager conversations, for each team, ask to talk to a few individual contributors on teams that you\u2019re serious about**. This isn\u2019t just a stalling tactic. These are the people you\u2019ll be working closely with every day, and they\u2019re the ones doing the job you may have in the future. They\u2019re also less likely to do hard sells, and if you ask thoughtful questions, you\u2019ll learn a lot about what to expect. We\u2019re always surprised by how few candidates ask to speak to their future peers, out of a mistaken concern that asking for too much will make them look disinterested or unengaged.\nJust like with hiring manager calls, if you need to slow things down, we recommend scheduling calls with your peers a few days apart.\n\n### Situations where slow-playing may bite you, and how to know the difference\n\nWe have seen two instances when our advice about slow-playing could backfire. You probably remember when companies started to freeze hiring aggressively in mid-2022 \u2014 if you didn\u2019t get matched before the ax came down, you were left out in the cold. Much more recently, we heard from some of our users that Meta put a pause on team matching for E4 roles (largely outside the Bay Area), and many candidates were stuck in a holding pattern (while Meta figured out headcount constraints, though it looks like it\u2019s since been resolved, and picking back up in earnest. Slow-playing and then getting stuck is obviously an unfortunate situation, as is being on the wrong end of a hiring freeze, but these situations are rare, and in our humble opinion, not worth optimizing for \u2014 in most cases, you will not be dealing with an impending freeze or stalled matching. If you\u2019re unsure about team supply or the state of hiring, you can do two things:\n\n1. Always ask your recruiter up front to share the number of teams that candidates have had the chance to talk to, on average, recently.\n2. Look at our [real-time graph of FAANG hiring volume](https://interviewingio-metabase.herokuapp.com/public/dashboard/11313b19-b9fd-4532-9a3f-d2aad7e027c3) (as opposed to the graph above, which is a monthly snapshot). In this real-time graph, you can see what portion of our mock interview volume is dedicated to practice in the style of Meta, Amazon, and Google. Historically, our purchasing behavior has lined up very well with what\u2019s actually going on in the market, and the rate of change in this graph should give you an idea of whether Meta is slowing down. As you can see, there was a dip in February (and one in December, but that almost always happens because hiring slows down over the holidays). If you see dips like these, you\u2019ll want to make sure that you do (1) and ask your recruiter about the situation inside. You may also choose not to slow-play for too long.\n\nThere's one more situation where slow-playing may bite you. If you match with a team and really click well with the manager, to the point where you have your heart set on it, it may be wise to accept that team instead of trying to drag things out. We've heard of times where, even if the candidate asked the manager about open headcount and confirmed they didn't have to rush, the role got filled from under them (they were able to talk to other teams afterwards but missed the chance to be on that specific team). If a specific team feels irreplaceable to you and you'd be crushed if you didn't get it, then that may be more important than maximizing your negotiation.\n\n### Build rapport with every hiring manager you talk to\n\nOutside of using the team-matching process to control your timeline, there is one other important tactical piece of advice: Do your best to build rapport with hiring managers.\n\n**As we said above, recruiters are trying to close the deal. That\u2019s their job. Hiring managers, on the other hand, are trying to lay the groundwork for a good working relationship with you**. As a result, their interests are much more aligned with yours. Of course, they still want to close you, but it\u2019s not worth it to them to employ high-pressure tactics, and it\u2019s not something they\u2019re trained in or comfortable with (in fact, many of them hated these tactics when they were on the other end of it while looking for work)[5](#user-content-fn-5).\n\nAs such, hiring managers will generally be a lot more transparent with you about how much time you actually have to make a decision, and their answers will likely be very different from the ones you get from recruiters.\n\nWe\u2019ve advised all of our Meta candidates to ask their prospective hiring managers about when they realistically have to make a decision by, and the differences between what the hiring manager has told them (\u201cTake your time; you have a few weeks at least.\u201d) and what their recruiter has told them (\u201cWe\u2019re talking to a lot of candidates for that team. To ensure your spot, you should make a decision in the next few days.\u201d) are stark.\n\nThere\u2019s simply no downside to building rapport with hiring managers. At worst, you make a professional connection. At best, you get a head start on a great working relationship with your new boss.\n\n**One practical note: Always ask your hiring manager for their email address in case you have more questions later**. This way, if your recruiter starts telling you that you need to make a decision by Friday, you can ping your hiring manager, explain that you\u2019re still thinking, and ask if it\u2019s OK to take a few more days. Almost always they will say yes.\n\n### Actually negotiate (this is the easy part)\n\nIf you\u2019ve done everything else in this post, the negotiation is the easy part. By now, you\u2019ve wrapped up team matching, chosen a team, and have likely gotten an aggressive offer deadline.\n\nYou have also not shared any offer details till now. As we said at the beginning of this post, the success of your strategy hinges on the recruiter not being aware of the other companies you\u2019re interviewing with. This will be the first time they find out about it, and that will put them on their proverbial back foot.\n\n![](https://64.media.tumblr.com/4e9087066942c43406fd478dcc34ba90/f2c80ff8d660cda3-62/s540x810/9f0a2c2a8f29b0782c59e0551444d001ec1a7a26.gif)\n\nTo respond to the offer, you can send an email[6](#user-content-fn-6) that looks something like the below. The details will differ, and how much you reveal about the other offers will vary, but here\u2019s the general idea.\n\n---\n\n*Hey [Recruiter name],*\n\n*Thank you so much for the offer, for working with me throughout this process, and for all your help with team matching. I wanted to share some details with you. I currently have offers from {Company 1}, {Company 2}, and {Company 3}.\n\n{Company 1} has offered me a significantly higher base salary of $220k. {Company 2} has a comparable base but has offered me significantly more equity: $500k. I know {Company 2} is a startup, but they\u2019re late stage and handing out RSUs. Those RSUs are as valuable to me as public company equity.\n\nFinally, {Company 3} has thrown in a meaningful signing bonus, and their performance bonus is actually at 25%, not 15%.\n\nI\u2019m very excited about the opportunity to work at Meta and about the team. {Insert some authentic reasons why you\u2019re excited about the company, the team, your new boss, etc.} It\u2019d be great to see a meaningful increase in compensation to make my decision easier.*\n\n*Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you.*\n\n---\n\nBy the way, this isn\u2019t the only approach you can take, and with other companies, you might have better luck with the [Reverse Used Car Salesman](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter). However, in our experience, if you don\u2019t share offer details, your Meta recruiter will immediately ask you to share, so you might as well control the flow of information.\n\nIn the template above, I\u2019ve assumed that not all of your offers are stronger than Meta\u2019s across the board, which is why I\u2019ve cherry-picked which pieces to share. Sometimes, if you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll have multiple offers that have a higher base, more equity, and a higher signing bonus. In that case, it\u2019s less of a game of skill \u2014 just throw the numbers at them, and they\u2019ll exceed the other offers without much prompting.\n\nIf you run this play, your recruiter will apologize for low-balling you, blaming the \u201ccomputer\u201d for giving them those numbers. Then, like clockwork, you will see a $50k to $150k jump in your offer (precisely how much depends on where your other offers are from and how strong they are).[7](#user-content-fn-7)\n\nNow, whether you take that offer is up to you.\n\nSome closing thoughts. I\u2019m a capitalist. Meta\u2019s behavior here is aggressively capitalistic, if short-sighted \u2013 once other FAANGs start meaningfully hiring again, and Meta employees figure out that there\u2019s a $150k comp differential between people with the same job title, they\u2019re going to pay the piper and likely see a bunch of attrition. Ultimately, the market will correct these practices. However, I also believe that individuals have the right and duty to be as informed as possible and to wield whatever weapons in their arsenal to advocate for themselves, rather than waiting on the mercy of slow, indifferent market forces.\n\nAs such, we hope this post has given you some ammunition in your negotiations and helped reduce the information asymmetry between you and Meta, a huge, aggressive player with basically a monopoly on eng hiring at the moment. And we hope that if anyone from Meta is reading this, it\u2019ll spark some internal conversations about what\u2019s right. And if they don\u2019t, other FAANGs\u2019 recruiters will swoop in soon enough.\n\nWant to know if you\u2019re ready to interview at Meta? Do anonymous mock interviews with real Meta interviewers, and see exactly where you stack up.\n\n[See available times](https://interviewing.io/signup)\n\n![](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcta.47351a0d.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. How team matching works changed fairly recently. In the past, you\u2019d get an offer before you matched with a team and do a 6-week \u201cbootcamp\u201d where you\u2019d get up to speed on Meta\u2019s tech stack, infrastructure, and systems, followed by a multi-week \u201cspeed dating\u201d-esque team matching cycle. Bootcamp still exists, but now it's much shorter (2-4 weeks), and the focus is getting new engineers ramped up on generic tools. After that, new engineers continue to ramp up on their specific teams. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n2. We\u2019ve recently heard that Meta may now be insisting that team matching conversations happen in serial, i.e., you can only do one at a time. However, this doesn\u2019t meaningfully change our advice. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-2)\n3. You might say, \u201cAline, why can\u2019t I just make up offers?\u201d We could never, in good conscience, advise that. It\u2019s unethical, and though I\u2019d argue that while Meta\u2019s negotiation practices are also unethical, that\u2019s not the way to win. Outside of ethical considerations, while the risks of getting caught are low, they\u2019re not zero. Lying about offers, in our mind, is the last refuge of the incompetent. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-3)\n4. The advice in this post is orthogonal from your career goals and what you want to work on. This blog post is about navigating an unfair system filled with opaque rules while maximizing your cash. It is not about self-actualization, though we\u2019d argue that creating the most optionality for yourself helps with self-actualization as well. You can also talk to smaller companies and use your big-co offers as leverage to increase your startup equity. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but more detail on optionality and self-actualization is outside the scope of this post. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-4)\n5. Of course, some hiring managers will use high-pressure sales tactics or create false timelines to try to close you. But that\u2019s the exception rather than the rule. You can decide if that\u2019s something that you want to weigh when judging whether or not you want to work for them. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-5)\n6. We strongly urge you to avoid negotiating over the phone and over text, whenever possible. Your recruiter does 5 of these calls a day. You might do one of these calls every few years. Do the hard part over email. It\u2019s the best way to level the playing field. [Read this post](https://interviewing.io/blog/sabotage-salary-negotiation-before-even-start) to learn how to avoid synchronous phone negotiations (just look for \u201cphone\u201d). [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-6)\n7. One advanced maneuver is to pit all your other companies against each other and raise up their initial offers BEFORE talking to Meta. We\u2019ll likely write about how to run this play in a future post. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-7)\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

This is the fourth post in our Guest Author series.*\n\n*In this post, our Guest Author, Alexey Komissarouk, talks about how advantageous it is to have hiring managers (rather than individual members of the team) conduct the first technical screen, effectively combining the technical interview and the hiring manager sell call. At [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/), where the first interaction an engineering candidate will have with a company is always with another engineer (and often with a hiring manager), we\u2019re strong advocates of this approach. Why? Because selling matters at every stage of the process \u2014 in this market, interviews aren\u2019t just for vetting anymore \u2014 and hiring managers can sell in a way that a peer cannot. And because hiring managers are going to be among the best-calibrated interviewers, which means that they\u2019ll save the rest of the team time downstream.*\n\n![Author avatar](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff3f50_alexey_scaled_e1606329022499_edef8e39a7.webp&w=384&q=75 \"Alexey Komissarouk\")\n\nAlexey Komissarouk\n\nAlexey Komissarouk is a growth engineering leader. He is currently Head of Growth Engineering at MasterClass. Before that, he spent 2016-2020 at Opendoor, first as an early engineer, then as an Engineering Manager. Between 2013 and 2016, he built out a product engineering consulting company, helping clients such as Dropbox, Pebble, Boomerang, and Binti grow and expand lines of business through a combination of product management and engineering. In his other lives, Alexey co-founded a boutique work+travel company, Hacker Paradise. Since the company\u2019s inception in 2015, they\u2019ve run trips to over a dozen locations and been joined by more than 800 alumni.\n\n*Caveat: Yes, yes, almost everything about the interviewing / recruiting process is broken. Sometimes though, you just have to play the hand you\u2019re dealt and settle for minor improvements.*\n\nThe 75-minute HMTPS is my proposed minor improvement.\n\n![Cartoon: where do you see yourself in five years?](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Foatmeal_interviewing_1_97fd522520.webp&w=1080&q=75 \"A serious question\")\n\nHat tip to The Oatmeal\n\n## What is the HMTPS?\n\nIt stands for \u201cHiring Manager Technical Phone Screen.\u201d Since you asked, I\u2019ve been pronouncing it \u201cham-tips.\u201d It\u2019s the call a candidate will have after their RPS (Recruiter Phone Screen), but before their onsite.\n\nThis combines two calls: the Technical Phone Screen (TPS), which is a coding exercise that usually happens before the onsite, and the HMS call, which is a call with the Hiring Manager (your would-be manager) that can be done before an onsite, or after, or not at all.\n\nInstead of leaving the HMS call to languish, I combine them into one \u2013 the HMTPS. It takes 75 minutes.\n\n## Why combine the two interviews?\n\nAn ideal interview loop has as few steps as possible, and gets to a decision ASAP. By combining these two steps you shorten the intro-to-offer by ~1 week and reduce candidate dropoff by 5-10%.\n\nIt\u2019s also a lot less work for recruiters playing scheduling battleship.[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n\nFinally, Hiring Managers will, on average, be better at selling working at the company \u2013 it\u2019s kind of their job.\n\n## Why 75 minutes?\n\nWe\u2019re combining a 30-minute call and a 60-minute call, and combining the 15-minute Q&A at the end of each into one, like so:\n\n![Chart: Consolidating pre-onsite interviews to improve hiring velocity](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FConsolidating_pre_onsite_interviews_to_improve_hiring_velocity_3_3fd8cff5d1.webp&w=1920&q=75 \"Improving hiring velocity\")\n\nI\u2019m also more comfortable shortening the ~50 minute technical question into 30 minutes because (a) I\u2019m pretty calibrated on my question, having run it 200+ times at this point, and so can get most of the signal I\u2019m looking for within the first 30 minutes.\n\nI\u2019ve tried doing this call in 60 minutes and it ends up feeling pretty rushed; not to say somebody else couldn\u2019t pull that off, but I\u2019ve appreciated the bit of space. Also, since most candidates don\u2019t schedule in 15-minute increments, we can always go a little long (up to the 90 minute mark) if we need to.\n\n## Why is this good for the hiring manager?\n\nFirst, it\u2019s easier to schedule (usually towards the end of the day). Second, it usually gives me enough time with the candidate so that I end up being pretty confident about how they\u2019ll do both at the job and on the onsite. I haven\u2019t quantified this yet, but anecdotally I have been surprised by onsite interviewer feedback much more rarely when I do this.\n\n## Why is this good for the candidate?\n\nIt\u2019s one fewer hoop to jump through. Also, whether or not they get along with me as their future manager \u2013 both technically and interpersonally \u2013 can, and should, be a pretty strong determinant as to whether they should continue with the process. This gives a more accurate and realistic signal, since we are both coding together and talking about work.\n\n## When is this a bad idea?\n\nThis makes the Hiring Manager a bit of a bottleneck in interviewing; once a company gets to the point where you are interviewing for titles like \u201cSenior Software Engineer, Team TBD\u201d you have to round robin TPS-es to the rest of your [Phone Screen Team](https://interviewing.io/blog/technical-phone-screen-superforecasters).\n\nAlso, as the HM I likely have some unreasonable biases (Golang engineers, I\u2019m looking at you), and making me the bottleneck in interviewing exacerbates those. That said, the HM\u2019s bias is going to be applied sooner or later in the interview process, and my take is that between the more effective selling and the time savings (both for the HMTPS and downstream), the benefits outlined are worth it.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1.

Here\u2019s the data.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: February 26, 2017; Last updated: May 1, 2023\n\nIf you\u2019re an engineer who\u2019s been endorsed on LinkedIn for any number of languages/frameworks/skills, you\u2019ve probably noticed that something isn\u2019t quite right. Maybe they\u2019re frameworks you\u2019ve never touched or languages you haven\u2019t used since freshman year of college. No matter the specifics, you\u2019re probably at least a bit wary of the value of the LinkedIn endorsements feature. The internets, too, don\u2019t disappoint in enumerating some [absurd potential endorsements](https://www.socialtalent.co/blog/endorsement-bombing) or in [bemoaning the lack of relevance of said endorsements](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6292348), even when they\u2019re given in earnest.\n\nHaving a gut feeling for this is one thing, but we were curious about whether we could actually come up with some numbers that showed how useless endorsements can be, and we weren\u2019t disappointed. If you want graphs and numbers, scroll down to the \u201cHere\u2019s the data\u201d section below. Otherwise, humor me and read my completely speculative take on why endorsements exist in the first place.\n\n## LinkedIn endorsements are just noisy crowdsourced tagging\n\nPretend for a moment that you\u2019re a recruiter who\u2019s been tasked with filling an engineering role. You\u2019re one of many people who pays LinkedIn ~$9K/year for a recruiter seat on their platform. That hefty price tag broadens your search radius (which is otherwise artificially constrained) and lets you search the entire system. Let\u2019s say you have to find a strong back-end engineer. How do you begin?\n\nUnfortunately, LinkedIn\u2019s faceted search (pictured below) doesn\u2019t come with a \u201ccan code\u201d filter.\n\n![Screenshot of LinkedIn search](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Flinkedin_can_code_8178d2dc43.png&w=640&q=75 \"LinkedIn search\")\n\nSo, instead of searching for what you really want, you have to rely on proxies. Some obvious proxies, [even though they\u2019re not that great](https://interviewing.io/blog/lessons-from-3000-technical-interviews), might be where someone went to school or where they\u2019ve worked before. **However, if you need to look for engineering ability, you\u2019re going to have to get more specific. If you\u2019re like most recruiters, you\u2019ll first look for the main programming language your company uses** (despite [knowledge of a specific language not being a good indicator of programming ability](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/) and despite most hiring managers not caring which languages their engineers know) and then go from there.\n\n**Now pretend you\u2019re LinkedIn. You have no data about how good people are at coding, and though you do have a lot of resume/biographical data, that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.** You can try relying on engineers filling in their own profiles with languages they know, but given that engineers tend to be pretty skittish about filling in their LinkedIn profile with a bunch of buzzwords, what do you do?\n\n**You build a crowdsourced tagger, of course! Then, all of a sudden, your users will do your work for you.** Why do I think this is the case? Well, if LinkedIn cared about true endorsements rather than perpetuating the skills-based myth that keeps recruiters in their ecosystem, they could have written a weighted endorsement system by now, at the very least. That way, an endorsement from someone with expertise in some field might mean more than an endorsement from your mom (unless, of course, she\u2019s an expert in the field).\n\nBut they don\u2019t do that, or at least they don\u2019t surface it in candidate search. It\u2019s not worth it. Because the point of endorsements isn\u2019t to get at the truth. It\u2019s to keep recruiters feeling like they\u2019re getting value out of the faceted search they\u2019re paying almost $10K per seat for. In other words, improving the fidelity of endorsements would likely cannibalize LinkedIn\u2019s revenue.\n\nYou could make the counterargument that despite the noise, LinkedIn endorsements still carry enough signal to be a useful first-pass filter and that having them is more useful than not having them. This is the question I was curious about, so I decided to cross-reference our users\u2019 interview data with their LinkedIn endorsements.\n\n## The setup\n\nSo, what data do we have? First, for context, interviewing.io is a platform where people can practice technical interviewing anonymously with interviewers from top companies and, in the process, find jobs. Do well in practice, and you get guaranteed (and anonymous!) technical interviews at companies like Uber, Twitch, Lyft, and more. Over the course of our existence, we\u2019ve amassed performance data from close to 5,000 real and practice interviews.\n\nWhen an interviewer and an interviewee match on our platform, they meet in a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard and jump right into a technical question. Interview questions on the platform tend to fall into the category of what you\u2019d encounter at a phone screen for a back-end software engineering role. Some examples of these interviews can be found on our [public recordings](https://interviewing.io/mocks) page.\n\nAfter every interview, interviewers rate interviewees on a few different dimensions, including technical ability. Technical ability gets rated on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 is \u201cpoor\u201d and 4 is \u201camazing!\u201d. On our platform, a score of 3 or above has generally meant that the person was good enough to move forward. You can see what our feedback form looks like below:\n\n![Screenshot of Interviewing.io interview feedback form highlighting the question: how were their technical skills?](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ftech_skills_109973cdf5.png&w=1920&q=75 \"Interviewing.io interview feedback form\")\n\nAs promised, I cross-referenced our data with our users\u2019 LinkedIn profiles and found some interesting, albeit not that surprising, stuff.\n\n## Endorsements vs. what languages people actually program in\n\nThe first thing I looked at was whether the programming language people interviewed in most frequently had any relationship to the programming language for which they were most endorsed. It was nice that, across the board, people tended to prefer one language for their interviews, so we didn\u2019t really have a lot of edge cases to contend with.\n\n**It turns out that people\u2019s interview language of choice matched their most endorsed language on LinkedIn just under 50% of the time.**\n\nOf course, just because you\u2019ve been endorsed a lot for a specific language doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re not good at the other languages you\u2019ve been endorsed for. To dig deeper, I took a look at whether our users had been endorsed for their interview language of choice at all. It turns out that people were endorsed for their language of choice 72% of the time. This isn\u2019t a particularly powerful statement, though, because most people on our platform have been endorsed for at least 5 programming languages.\n\nThat said, even when an engineer had been endorsed for their interview language of choice, that language appeared in their \u201cfeatured skills\u201d section only 31% of the time. This means that **most of the time, recruiters would have to click \u201cView more\u201d** (see below) **to see the language that people prefer to code in, if it\u2019s even listed in the first place**.\n\n![Screenshot showing a list of Featured Skills & Endorsements](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Flinkedin_endorsement_270b56e616.png&w=1920&q=75 \"LinkedIn: Featured Skills & Endorsements\")\n\nSo, how often were people endorsed for their language of choice? Quantifying endorsements is a bit fuzzy, but to answer this meaningfully, I looked at how often people were endorsed for that language relative to how often they were endorsed for their most-endorsed language, in the cases when the two languages weren\u2019t the same (recall that this happened about half the time). Perhaps if these numbers were close to 1 most of the time, then endorsements might carry some signal. As you can see in the histogram below, this was not the case at all.\n\nThe x-axis above is how often people were endorsed for their interview language of choice relative to their most-endorsed language. The bars on the left are cases when someone was barely endorsed for their language of choice, and all the way to right are cases when people were endorsed for both languages equally as often. All told, the distribution is actually pretty uniform, making for more noise than signal.\n\n## LinkedIn endorsements vs. interview performance\n\nThe next thing I looked at was whether there was any correspondence between how heavily endorsed someone was on LinkedIn and their interview performance. This time, to quantify the strength of someone\u2019s endorsements, I looked at how many times someone was endorsed for their most-endorsed language and correlated that to their average technical score in interviews on interviewing.io.\n\nBelow, you can see a scatter plot of technical ability vs. LinkedIn endorsements, as well as my attempt to fit a line through it. **As you can see, the R^2 is piss-poor, meaning that there isn\u2019t a relationship between how heavily endorsed someone is and their technical ability to speak of.**\n\n## LinkedIn Endorsements vs. no endorsements\u2026 and closing thoughts\n\nLastly, I took a look at whether having any endorsements in the first place mattered with respect to interview performance. If I\u2019m honest, I was hoping there\u2019d be a negative correlation, i.e. if you don\u2019t have endorsements, you\u2019re a better coder. After running some significance testing, though, **it became clear that having any endorsements at all (or not) doesn\u2019t matter.**\n\nSo, where does this leave us? As long as there\u2019s money to be made in peddling low-signal proxies, endorsements won\u2019t go away and probably won\u2019t get much better. It is my hope, though, that any recruiters reading this will take a second look at the candidates they\u2019re sourcing and try to, where possible, look at each candidate as more than the sum of their buzzword parts.\n\n*Thanks to Liz Graves for her help with the data annotation for this post.*\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

Part 2 of 2.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: July 30, 2024; Last updated: November 2, 2024\n\nIn [part 1 of this post](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-to-get-in-the-door-at-top-companies-part-1), we talked about which channels are most effective for getting in the door and did an analysis of those channels along two axes: effectiveness and how much control you actually have. Here\u2019s a quick summary.\n\n![A diagram comparing the effectiveness and utility of all the recruitment/hiring channels to how much control you have over them.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/effectiveness_and_utility_quadrant_for_channels_1c6bec37f1.png)\n\nIn the quadrant above, you can see that while getting contacted by an in-house recruiter is very effective, whether you get contacted or not is largely out of your hands. The channel that maximizes both effectiveness and control is cold outreach to hiring managers (not recruiters!) \u201cdone right\u201d. What does \u201cdone right\u201d mean? That\u2019s what we\u2019ll talk about in this post (part 2 of 2). Most people do this type of outreach incorrectly. Here, we\u2019ll get very tactical and tell you exactly what to say and do to reach out to hiring managers at the companies you\u2019re interested in and actually get responses.\n\nHere\u2019s our recommended, hyper-practical approach.\n\n## Prerequisites/tooling\n\n- Buy a month or two of LinkedIn Sales Navigator. This will run you a few hundred dollars, but it\u2019s worth it.\n- Get an account with an email discovery tool like [RocketReach](https://rocketreach.co/) (an excellent email discovery tool).\n- Get [Streak](https://www.streak.com/mail-merge-gmail), which lets you do mail merges in Gmail. You create an email template, with variables for everything from recipient name to long snippets of personalized text, and then you upload a CSV with all the values. The resulting emails feel personalized but get sent to hundreds of people at once.\n\n## Treat your job search like a sales funnel\n\nIf you\u2019re an engineer, chances are you haven\u2019t ever done sales (maybe you had a job in high school selling Cutco knives or magazines, in which case what we\u2019re about to say will resonate). But if you do sales for any appreciable amount of time, you\u2019ll start thinking about everything in life as a funnel.\n\nFunnels are wide at the top and narrow at the bottom. That\u2019s why they\u2019re such an apt metaphor for the sales process \u2014 you do a lot of outreach, and you don\u2019t get many responses. Of the responses you do get, relatively few will do the thing you want them to do. And even fewer will ultimately \u201cclose\u201d (aka, buying \u2014 or, in this case, hiring).\n\nIn your engineering career, you\u2019ve intellectually mastered many abstract concepts that are much more complex than a funnel. Despite its simplicity, however, the funnel is one of the hardest concepts to internalize emotionally, especially for people who are used to having control over outcomes. When you write code for *n* hours, you can expect that you will build *m* features.\n\nIn sales though, you do a lot of work, very little of it will pan out, and when it does pan out, it can feel almost random; an impersonal, mediocre email gets a response while your beautifully targeted email is met with deafening silence.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s rejection. When you apply to jobs online and don\u2019t hear back, it stings, but the sting is softened by the possibility that a human never even saw your application. You\u2019re not reaching out to people when you apply online; you\u2019re dealing with a bureaucratic machine.\n\nOn the other hand, when you email a real human and they don\u2019t respond, that hurts: you put yourself out there, someone made a value judgment about you, and you lost.\n\n**The good news is that, after a while, the pain lessens, and you build up some useful emotional calluses and acquire the thousand-yard stare of someone who\u2019s been rejected a million times for a million reasons, ranging from soul-crushingly legitimate to incontrovertibly random.** Sadly, there\u2019s no shortcut. You\u2019ve got to do the reps, you\u2019ve got to get the rejections, and you\u2019ve got to pick yourself up again. You get used to it, and then it doesn\u2019t hurt as much, because experience has taught you that if you keep going, you will eventually get to a yes.\n\n## What to actually do\n\n**First, come up with a target list of companies.** How to do that is out of scope for this post, but we may write about it in the future. For now, we\u2019ll assume you have a list.\n\nOnce you have your list of companies, use LinkedIn Sales Navigator to find hiring managers at those companies (or founders or directors or VPs, as above). Below is an example query where we look for Google hiring managers.\n\nYou might think that Google is so big that sifting through all their various hiring managers will be intractable. Fortunately, you can whittle down the list to a pretty manageable size by applying some filters.\n\n![linkedin_sales_navigator.png](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/linkedin_sales_navigator_1543713d2a.png)\n\nHere are our filters:\n\n- **Just targeting managers**, not directors or VPs. Google is a huge organization. You want the people who are most likely to help, and they\u2019re the ones who are struggling to hire for their teams.\n- **In position for less than 2 years:** These are the people who are still trying to prove themselves and who are less likely to have a long-standing relationship with their recruiter to the point where they only rely on internal recruiting and overlook other sources of candidates.\n- **Geography:** Let's focus on the places we most want to work.\n- **1st- or 2nd-degree connection:** This way, when they look you up, they\u2019ll see some social proof. You can expand this to 3rd-degree connections, if needed.\n\n**Once you have your list, put their LinkedIn URLs into a spreadsheet. Then, do a pass through your targets\u2019 profiles and see if any of them link to personal websites, social media accounts, blogs, or anything else that will help you find common ground with them.** Add any useful links in your spreadsheet because we\u2019ll be mining them when we actually write our emails.\n\n### Look up their email addresses\n\n**Once you have your list of LinkedIn URLs, use a tool like RocketReach to look up their emails.**\n\nWhy not reach out on LinkedIn? While recruiters live on LinkedIn, managers generally do not. Possibly, they don't even like or check LinkedIn much. They live in their emails, so that's where you want to target them.\n\nRocketReach is a nice tool for email discovery because 1) it takes LinkedIn URLs as inputs and 2) its email database is generally up-to-date and correct.[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n\nIf RocketReach fails or you don't wish to pay for it, you might just be able to guess their email address, as email addresses tend to follow common forms: [aline@interviewing.io](mailto:aline@interviewing.io) (my actual email address), [alerner@interviewing.io](mailto:alerner@interviewing.io), or [aline.lerner@interviewing.io](mailto:aline.lerner@interviewing.io).\n\nWhere possible, contact managers via their work email address.[2](#user-content-fn-2) In some cases, you won\u2019t be able to find their work email, in which case it\u2019s acceptable to fall back to their personal email.\n\n### Write succinct, highly personalized emails\n\n**Next, compose a fairly personalized, yet short, email.** All too often, candidates write a long, generic cover letter that\u2019s obviously been sent to a ton of people. I get many emails that look like this:\n\n![Example 1 of a bad cold email](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bad_cold_email_8ed5f88af2.png)\n\n\nDon\u2019t do this!\n\n![Example 2 of a bad cold email](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bad_cold_email_2_cd282fccc0.png)\n\n\nDon\u2019t do this either! There is nothing here about why this candidate is a good fit for interviewing.io, and the bullets aren\u2019t compelling enough on their own. Note that this particular email is from a marketer, not an engineer, but the anti-patterns are the same.\n\nEmails like the above are impersonal, but worst of all, they have a poor signal-to-noise ratio \u2014 I want to find a reason to say yes and to invest my valuable time into this person. But they\u2019re not giving me one, and they\u2019re making me work for it in the process.\n\n- **Don't open email with how they found you.** This is a big pet peeve of ours. I don\u2019t care how you found me! I know I\u2019m on LinkedIn. What I care about is why talking to you will add value for me or why you\u2019re interesting. Use the most significant real estate in the email, the first sentence, to tell me that!\n- **Don't be overly formal in how you address the person. Use their first name.**\n- **Don't get their gender wrong** (e.g., referring to a woman as \"sir\" \u2014 you\u2019d be surprised how often this happens).\n- **Don't paste in a generic cover letter.** These are sure to get ignored immediately \u2014 if you\u2019re not going to put in the effort to write to me personally, why would I put in the effort to read your email?\n- **Don't forget to include a link to a LinkedIn or a personal website.** We don\u2019t recommend attaching your resume, though. It can seem overly formal/somewhat presumptuous if you're trying to build rapport.\n\nMore broadly, if you want someone to go out on a limb for you, make it dead simple for them to justify expending their social/political capital on you. Hiring managers, as a rule, want to help. Make it a no-brainer for them.\n\nThere are three components to a great cold email:\n\n1. Common ground with your target\n2. Proof that you\u2019re worthy of their time\n3. A strong call to action\n\nNot every cold email will have (1) because you won\u2019t always be able to find common ground with everyone \u2014 there\u2019s simply not enough information out there about some targets to be able to craft a compelling narrative that\u2019s highly personalized to them.\n\nBut every cold email you write should have (2). It is your job to sell yourself quickly and succinctly. You want your target to feel like they\u2019d be an idiot to pass up the chance to talk to you.\n\n#### Finding common ground\n\nThe email below is personal, succinct, and finds common ground. Not only that, but it conveniently finds common ground that *benefits the candidate* (a soft-spot for non-traditional candidates, like himself!).\n\n![Example 1 of a good cold email](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/good_cold_email_2_8ecdbfe927.png)\n\nTo find common ground, reference something your target cares about. Then either show them that you care about it too or that helping you would fit into their worldview and further that cause.\n\nAs we mentioned above, finding common ground may be tough because there might not be enough information available about your target, but it\u2019s important to do the work before you give up on this route \u2014 finding common ground is the tactic that\u2019s going to get you the highest response rates.\n\nHere are some examples of great ways to build common ground:\n\n- Reference a project they worked on (maybe they wrote a blog post about it, mentioned it in a comment on Hacker News, or are a contributor to some open source project). Then\u2026\n  - If possible, talk about relevant work you\u2019ve done. It\u2019s important not to make this connection too tenuous. If you do, this approach might backfire because they\u2019ll start to get excited about you, only to be let down and ultimately feel tricked.\n  - If you do not have relevant work to share, ask a thoughtful question or two about theirs.\n- Reference a controversial point of view that they hold, and affirm it in an authentic way.\n- In the absence of something technical, it\u2019s okay to reference something non-technical you've seen on their public profiles. We've seen candidates connect with strangers based on a shared love of Star Wars or Hearthstone.\n\nWe understand that you won't always be able to find common ground. But if you can, it'll help you a lot, especially if you\u2019re light on social proof or accomplishments.\n\n#### Selling yourself\n\nSelling yourself is usually about one of two things:\n\n- Accomplishments: What have you built or created?\n- Social proof: Have you worked at a top company or attended a top school?\n\nSome people are fortunate enough to have both, but many will have just one. That\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll work with what you have!\n\n#### Accomplishments\n\nWhat have you done that most other people haven\u2019t? What have you done that, if you were to tell it to a stranger, would cause them to pause and think you're special or interesting?\n\nBelow are some examples:\n\n- You\u2019ve had a blog post about a technical topic or a personal project do well[3](#user-content-fn-3) on Hacker News, Reddit, or social media.\n- Something you built at work got some great press when your company announced its last funding round.\n- You refactored a piece of code at work, and now it runs 100X faster.\n- You won a company hackathon.\n- You\u2019re a core contributor to a notable open-source project.\n- Something you built is being used by a number of other people.\n\n#### Social proof\n\n**Social proof is more about your pedigree. If you attended a top school or worked at a company known for having a high engineering bar, you should absolutely mention it!** People won't click on links or open your resume until *after* they're interested, so you need to get them interested right away. That is: you should spoon feed them the most impressive-sounding things about you out of the gate. This may feel strange and uncomfortable, like you\u2019re bragging. We assure you, however, that it\u2019s necessary to get your target\u2019s attention. They\u2019re not thinking you\u2019re bragging. They\u2019re thinking, \u201cIs this worth my time?\u201d Your job is to convince them that it is.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t forget to link to your LinkedIn or personal website. Attaching a resume may feel too heavy-handed for a first conversation, as we discussed above.\n\nHere's an example of a prospective intern, leveraging both social proof and accomplishments, to write a compelling email. His email isn't super personalized, but he did make some effort to say that what we do at interviewing.io is important.\n\n![Example 2 of a good cold email](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/good_cold_email_3_393cc556e3.png)\n  \n\n#### Formulating a strong call to action\n\n**A call to action is an invitation for the recipient to do something. You can go one of two ways with your call to action: ask for a job interview or start a conversation.** Which you do should be a function of how much firepower you have in the way of social proof and accomplishments. It\u2019s not fair, but if you can get your target\u2019s attention with one or both of those, being bold and asking for a job interview makes sense. This approach can be effective, but it won\u2019t work for most people\u2026 because most people don\u2019t have enough social proof or accomplishments to justify this type of request.\n\nIf you can\u2019t leverage social proof or accomplishments, you\u2019re going to have to work harder and bank entirely on building common ground, which will likely take some time and effort and involve a live conversation before they\u2019re convinced to expend their social capital on you.\n\nIf you\u2019re asking for an interview, just come right out and say it. You can use the intern candidate\u2019s email from earlier as a guide. However, this isn\u2019t our preferred way to do it, and we really recommend starting a conversation instead.\n\nTake a look at the email below.\n\n![Example 3 of a good cold email](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/good_cold_email_1_38095f2d40.png)\n\nIn this email, the candidate doesn\u2019t ask me about jobs \u2014 he just asks to meet to discuss a topic. Indeed, he\u2019s done his research. I write a *ton* about judging resumes, and it\u2019s a topic I could go on about for hours if you\u2019ll let me. His email read like he\u2019s genuinely interested in the subject and that we\u2019d have a good conversation, so of course I responded. You\u2019d be surprised how rare emails like this are. If you can find the topic your target cares about and write something that shows earnest, genuine interest, they\u2019ll respond.\n\n**With these emails, you\u2019re asking for a conversation, not a job interview\u2026 because the conversation is what will hopefully prove to the hiring manager that you\u2019re worth interviewing. *Then*, once you have a conversation, the hiring manager will walk away with the impression that you\u2019re a competent, thoughtful human being who\u2019s interested in this sort of work. From there, getting a job interview will feel like an afterthought.**\n\nAs such, don\u2019t talk about jobs at all in this type of email, and in this particular case, don\u2019t attach your resume \u2014 that will feel out of place and transactional. You can and should link to your LinkedIn so they know who you are and have some context. But spend the bulk of the email building common ground and coming up with an interesting reason for the two of you to talk.\n\n**This approach is much more effective than asking for an interview out of the gate!** You\u2019re not going to land a job from one email, so, as with any seemingly insurmountable goal, it\u2019s important to think of your outreach as a series of steps where you put one foot in front of the other. Like in sales, all you need is to get to a conversation.\n\nIf your call to action is to set up a time to talk (which it probably should be because it\u2019s specific), we recommend providing them with a time window. \"Would you want to meet up sometime?\" puts the burden on the recipient to pose a time, while \"Can we talk next Monday at 3pm?\" is problematic because, most likely, they aren't free then. Instead, try something like the candidate above did: \"Would you be available sometime within the next two weeks for a thirty-minute call? I'm free most weekdays between X and Y and can pretty much do any time on weekends if those are better for you.\"\n\n## Two templates for you to use\n\n**Below are two templates you can use for cold outreach. The first one is ideal but requires more effort and can't always be used. The second one is weaker but more generic.** You can choose what fits your needs best. We expect both of these templates to be far more effective than throwing your resume into the blackhole of online portals.\n\n### Template #1: Use this template if your target has an online presence\n\nThis template includes common ground, accomplishments/social proof, and a call to action. It will get you the highest response rates, possibly anywhere from 25-50%. However, it can be challenging to use because it requires you to 1) do a deep dive into their online presence and 2) tie what you find back to something you\u2019re doing. Sometimes, that tie-in might be tenuous or non-existent (in which case, maybe skip it).\n\nHey {Their First Name},\n\nI\u2019ve read your work on {insert some details about their writing}, and I {insert your thoughts on the work}.\n\n{If you can make the connection between their work and yours, talk about something similar you\u2019ve been working on.}\n\n{If you cannot, ask them a specific, thoughtful question about your work. Don\u2019t worry about making it \u201cthe perfect question\u201d like you might when you attend a talk and want to sound smart. Any earnest question will do. You don\u2019t have to use this as a chance to show off!}\n\n{Finally, close with a sentence or two about you, if you have some social proof or impressive accomplishments you can share.}\n\nWould you be up for a quick chat this week or next?\n\nBest,\n\n{Your name}  \n{Insert 1-2 useful links about you. If you have a personal site, that\u2019s great. If not, a LinkedIn will do.}\n\nNote that in this template, we leave some places for you to insert some social proof and your accomplishments. Even though this email is primarily about them and their work, and your references to yourself are primarily through that lens, it never hurts to drop in a few pieces of evidence that you\u2019re someone who\u2019s accomplished things and/or someone who looks good on paper.\n\n### Template #2: Use this template if you don\u2019t have anything except a LinkedIn profile for your target\n\nThe reality is that you won\u2019t always have enough information about your target to find common ground. In this case, you\u2019ll lead with accomplishments/social proof and a strong call to action. We expect this template will get you response rates anywhere from 5-25%, depending on the strength of your achievements and pedigree. That said, we recommend treating this template as a last resort. Using it means you\u2019ve exhausted any possibility of writing something personal.\n\nHey {Their First Name},\n\n{List 2 things about you. They can be impressive accomplishments of yours or social proof, as above.}\n\nI\u2019m really interested in the work you\u2019re doing at {Company Name}. {If you know what team they\u2019re on and are interested in that specific team or are familiar with that team\u2019s accomplishments, great! If not, just write a few earnest sentences about why the company is interesting to you.}\n\nWould you be up for a quick chat this week or next?\n\nBest,\n\n{Your name}  \n{Insert 1-2 useful links about you. If you have a personal site, that\u2019s great. If not, a LinkedIn will do.}\n\nKeep your note short. The intent here is to make your target believe you\u2019re an entity worth paying attention to, rather than them doing the easy thing: deleting your email.\n\nRegardless of which template you use, just like you have to manage your psychology when you prepare for technical interviews, you have to manage your psychology when doing outreach like this. You have to:\n\n- Mentally prepare yourself for the slog of writing personalized emails and doing the requisite research.\n- Get used to rejection. If you do write good emails and target the right people, you\u2019ll have a much better hit rate than when you apply online, but you will still get ghosted a lot, and it will sting much more because, this time, you actually tried. But you know what? If you stick with it and do this right, within a few months, you\u2019ll have a connection to a top-tier company.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve girded your proverbial loins, it\u2019s time to do the work. If you follow our advice, you\u2019ll get 1-2 orders of magnitude more responses than from applying online, and with this approach, you\u2019ll have at least a hiring manager at that company rooting for you!\n\nFootnotes:\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. RocketReach also has a LinkedIn-like faceted search you can use to find engineering managers, but we\u2019ve found that it\u2019s not nearly as reliable or rich as LinkedIn, which is why we recommend using LinkedIn for search and then RocketReach for email discovery. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n2. Recruiters should not contact candidates on their work email address, but that's because they're trying to make the candidate leave their job. You are trying to join the manager, which is why it's okay to use their work email address. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-2)\n3. Many people think that for something to be worth mentioning, it has to have gone viral. That\u2019s simply not correct \u2014 in our niche space, a few hundred likes or a few thousand upvotes is already really impressive. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-3)\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

Five years ago I founded interviewing.io, a technical recruiting marketplace that provides engineers with anonymous [mock interviews](https://interviewing.io/mocks) and then fast-tracks top performers\u2014regardless of who they are or how they look on paper\u2014at top companies.\n\nWe\u2019ve hosted close to 100K technical interviews on our platform and have helped thousands of engineers find jobs. For the last year or so, we\u2019ve also been running a [Fellowship program](https://interviewing.io/blog/announcing-the-interviewing-io-technical-interview-practice-fellowship) specifically for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds.\n\nThat\u2019s all to say that even though I have developed some strong opinions about \u201cdiversity hiring\u201d initiatives, my opinions are based not on anecdotes but on cold, hard data. And the data points to the following 3 problems with these initiatives:\n\n1. **Over-indexing on unconscious bias, which ignores the much bigger problem of discrimination based on pedigree (i.e., conscious bias):** Too many organizations invest in resume blinding and other attempts to mitigate unconscious bias at the top of the funnel. But they continue to ignore the much more problematic, ever-present *conscious* bias against engineers who didn\u2019t attend a top school or work at a top company, which is especially troubling given that there are many more underrepresented engineers who didn\u2019t attend top schools.\n2. **Focusing on bias in the middle of the funnel rather than the top:** The top of the funnel is orders of magnitude larger than the middle. By the time you get to the middle, you\u2019ve weeded out most of your candidates from underrepresented backgrounds, and the damage has been done. Investing in bias training during interviews, therefore, gives you diminishing returns and is more of an exercise in optics than an attempt to fix anything.\n3. **Ignoring the technical interview practice gap:** Technical interviews are a learned skill, but access to practice is not equitably distributed. As a result, marginalized groups often underperform\u2014not because they\u2019re worse at engineering but simply because they haven\u2019t had access to the same level of preparation.\n\nAll three of these problems are somewhat subtle and require a bit of explanation, but until they\u2019re addressed, we\u2019re not going to make meaningful progress toward equitable representation in software engineering.\n\n## Problem 1: Over-indexing on unconscious bias at the top of the funnel (while ignoring conscious bias)\n\nFirst off, what is the top of the funnel? In the case of hiring, this refers to the stage where we decide whether we want to move a candidate into our process. If a candidate applies online (inbound), this is the step where we look at their resume and decide whether or not to move forward. And if we\u2019re actively trying to bring candidates into our process, this is when we look at their public profile (usually LinkedIn) and decide if we want to reach out to them (outbound).\n\nWhether the candidate is inbound or outbound, we have limited information available to help us make a decision. The information we have available typically consists of a resume (or a resume-like profile) and contains biographical info like name, where they went to school and their graduation date, and their work history. From these few bits of data, we can glean\u2014intentionally or not\u2014a candidate\u2019s gender and sometimes their race, their age, and their pedigree (i.e., did they attend an elite school and/or work at a top company?).\n\n## Unconscious vs. conscious bias\n\nIn this context, unconscious bias refers to making quick judgments, often without being aware of it, against someone based on the biographical info and other traits gleaned from their resume. In the context of engineering hiring, we tend to focus specifically on reducing bias around attributes like gender and race (though of course discrimination based on other traits like sexual orientation, age, beliefs, disability, etc., is also unacceptable).\n\nConscious bias, on the other hand, is the very *intentional* decision not to move forward with candidates who lack pedigree, i.e., those who didn\u2019t attend an elite computer science school or work at a company with a well-established brand. \\*\\*Unlike unconscious bias, organizations don\u2019t typically condemn this, and more often than not, conscious bias is actually codified into the hiring process, with explicit rules for the recruiting team that say something like, \u201c\\*\\****These are the schools we hire from, and these are the companies we look for on a resume. If a candidate doesn\u2019t have either, let\u2019s not move forward.\u201d***\n\nEither way, at the top of the funnel, before we ever interact with a candidate, we must decide if we want to bring them in for an interview based on very limited information, and that\u2019s where things get complicated.\n\n## Why anonymizing resumes isn\u2019t enough\n\nAt the top of the funnel, the canonical way to mitigate unconscious bias is to anonymize resumes. The idea is that if we can remove all signals that might help us uncover someone\u2019s race and gender, then we, by definition, can\u2019t be biased, right?\n\nHere\u2019s the problem. Though anonymizing resumes isn\u2019t inherently bad, it\u2019s not nearly enough. In a nutshell, as long as we keep over-indexing on top schools and top companies, it\u2019s not mathematically possible to hit our goals, no matter how much unconscious bias mitigation and resume anonymization we perform.\n\nIt\u2019s a fact: there are far more women and people of color who didn\u2019t attend one of a handful of well-known universities than there are who did. To make matters worse, filtering based on pedigree doesn\u2019t really work! **As a result, the pedigree-based tradeoffs we currently make (in the name of keeping the bar high) exclude people from underrepresented backgrounds\u2026 without actually getting us the best candidates.**\n\n## Over-indexing on resumes and pedigree\n\nLet\u2019s talk about resumes first. The resume is a demonstrably terrible way to judge whether someone is a good engineer. People often talk about how, in the spirit of fairness, it\u2019s important to consider non-pedigreed candidates, but there\u2019s a tacit agreement that pedigree is useful and that we\u2019re doing something charitable by broadening the pool. As a result, we accept the premise that we\u2019re going to be either pragmatic or fair, but not both. However, everything I\u2019ve learned from being in this business more than a decade has shown me that pitting fairness against pedigree creates a false dichotomy.\n\nIn other words, resumes inherently don\u2019t carry enough signal about a candidate\u2019s engineering ability to be useful. I\u2019ve written extensively (and angrily) on this subject, and below I\u2019ve linked the TL;DRs for 3 studies that all point to resumes being largely useless:\n\n- [The number of typos and grammatical errors on someone\u2019s resume](https://interviewing.io/blog/lessons-from-a-years-worth-of-hiring-data) matters much more than where they worked or went to school (the latter, in fact, didn\u2019t matter at all)\n- [Neither recruiters nor engineers can figure out who the strong candidates are based on their resumes](https://interviewing.io/blog/resumes-suck-heres-the-data), and, more importantly, they all disagree with each other about what a good candidate looks like\n- Data from interviewing.io (based on thousands of interviews) has shown that [where someone went to school has no bearing on their performance](https://interviewing.io/blog/lessons-from-3000-technical-interviews) in technical interviews\n\n**Simply put, even if you don\u2019t care one iota about inclusion and just pragmatically want to hire the best candidates with the fewest amount of interviews, you should STILL stop focusing on resumes and pedigree.**\n\nSo we\u2019re making decisions based on an incorrect heuristic and bad data. That\u2019s not great, but what does it have to do with diversity? Here\u2019s the thing. If you make hiring decisions based on pedigree, the numbers simply aren\u2019t there, and it\u2019s mathematically impossible to reach your hiring goals.\n\nHere is some napkin math. Every year, about 60,000 students graduate in the US with a computer science degree. If you only hire from top schools, your pool narrows to about 6,000. Of those, about 1,500 are women and fewer than 1,000 are people of color. With the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) expecting nearly 140,000 new engineering jobs over the 2016\u201326 decade, it\u2019s laughable to believe that any given company will be able to meet its diversity goals by hiring this way.\n\n## What happens when you mitigate conscious bias\n\nBut what happens if you look beyond elite schools and start mitigating *conscious* bias? That\u2019s when you start to have a real shot. Below is a model we built to capture the size of the candidate pool (for gender, specifically) that shows what will happen if we keep hiring the way we\u2019re hiring now vs. expanding our pool beyond elite schools and focusing on what people can actually do, instead of how they look on paper.\n\n![Chart showing the change in gender parity gap over time](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fgender_parity_hiring_3653357b54.png&w=1080&q=75 \"Gender Parity in Hiring\")\n\nYou can read more about [how we built this model](https://interviewing.io/blog/we-ran-the-numbers-and-there-really-is-a-pipeline-problem-in-eng-hiring), but we looked at two alternative sources of candidates: MOOCs and bootcamps. In 2015 alone, over 35 million people signed up for at least one MOOC course, and in 2018 MOOCs collectively had over 100M students.\n\nBecause they\u2019re cheaper and much faster than a four-year program, bootcamps seem like a rational choice when compared to the price of attending a top university. Since 2013, bootcamp enrollment has grown 9X, with a total of 20,316 graduates in 2018. **Though these numbers represent enrollment across all genders, and the raw number of grads lags behind CS programs, the portion of women graduating from bootcamps is also on the rise and graduation from online programs has actually reached gender parity (as compared to only 20% in traditional CS programs).**\n\nBut, even if lower-tier schools and alternative programs have their fair share of talent, how do we surface the most qualified candidates in the absence of the signals we\u2019re used to? Good news. In this brave new world, where we have the technology to write code together remotely, and where we can collect data and reason about it, technology has the power to free us from relying on proxies.\n\nAt interviewing.io, we make it possible to move away from proxies by providing engineers with hyperrealistic, rigorous mock interviews and connecting top performers with employers, regardless of how the candidates look on paper.\n\nOr if you don\u2019t use us, there\u2019s a slew of asynchronous coding assessments like CodeSignal, HackerRank, and Triplebyte, that can help you filter down your candidates before you invest precious engineering time into interviewing them.\n\nSo, despite the numbers and the bevy of available solutions, why do we still latch on to mitigating unconscious bias? Sadly, it\u2019s easier. Removing names from a resume is eminently doable. Redefining credentialing in software engineering is really hard (I know, the interviewing.io team and I have been at this for over five years). But unless we can talk openly about this problem and stop pretending that unconscious bias mitigation will solve our problems, we can\u2019t make meaningful progress toward equitable representation.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve just talked about bias at the top of the funnel. What about the bias we encounter when, instead of looking at a piece of paper, we\u2019re interacting with another human, especially a human who doesn\u2019t look like us?\n\n## Problem 2: Focusing on bias in the middle of the funnel rather than the top\n\nThe second problem I\u2019ve observed occurs during the middle of the funnel, once candidates have made it through the door. Unconscious bias training tries to make us better at interacting with (and avoiding making judgments about) people who don\u2019t look like us. It\u2019s a well-intentioned attempt, but [sadly it\u2019s been shown not to work](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/gender-equality/focusing-on-what-works-for-workplace-diversity), and it can even be responsible for people digging their heels in on the prejudices they hold.\n\nMost importantly, and this is perhaps the more subtle point, by the time a candidate gets to an interviewer, numerically speaking, it\u2019s too late\u2014you\u2019ve already filtered out most of the candidates who would have moved your numbers, and any effort you put in at this step in the funnel gives you diminishing returns.\n\n![Diagram showing where bias exists vs where most training is focussed](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdiversity_hiring_funnel_fde8c49b99.png&w=1080&q=75 \"Diversity in Hiring\")\n\nPut another way, there are often 100X the number of candidates at the top of the funnel than at the next stage. Most get cut before they ever talk to a human, simply based on their resumes. Despite that, employers are investing in training interviewers, which unfortunately is only relevant at a stage that most of the non-traditional talent won\u2019t reach. Any gains we can make in the middle of the funnel are mathematically negligible compared to the gains we can make at the top (where, as you saw in the previous section, we persist in our conscious bias and call it a best practice).  \nEspecially when you have limited resources to mitigate bias in your process, and as more and more of your team fall victim to [diversity fatigue](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2020/05/27/has-diversity-become-a-dirty-word/?sh=9881c585a9bd), investing so much effort into a part of the funnel that has a very real cap on its ROI makes no sense\u2014even less so given that the thing you\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t even work.\n\n## Problem 3: Ignoring the technical interview practice gap\n\nOf all the problems with diversity hiring, this one is the most subtle and perhaps the most damaging. Because it\u2019s such an important (and tricky) topic that requires going in depth to fully understand, I encourage you to read the [detailed post that I wrote last week](https://interviewing.io/blog/technical-interview-practice-gap) focusing just on this topic. .\n\nAttending an elite computer science institution (like MIT, where I went) provides students with a number of benefits, but perhaps the most significant is boundless access to technical interview practice.\n\nMIT offered a multi-week course dedicated to passing technical interviews, and I got support from my peers who were interviewing at FAANG for internships and new grad positions. This allowed us to practice with each other, share our successes and failures, and recognize just how much of technical interviewing is a numbers game. **And we learned that bombing a [Google interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google#google) did not mean that you weren\u2019t meant to be an engineer. It just meant that you needed to work some more problems, do more mock interviews, and try again at Facebook.**\n\nBut let\u2019s put the anecdotal experience aside and examine the data that we at interviewing.io have collected. We\u2019ve hosted close to 100K interviews on our platform, which has taught us two things about the technical interview: 1) like standardized testing, it\u2019s a learned skill, and 2) unlike standardized testing, interview results are not consistent or repeatable\u2014the same candidate can ace one interview and fail another one the same day.\n\n## The importance of interview practice\n\nIn a recent study, [we looked at how people who got jobs at FAANG performed](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-know-ready-interview-faang) in practice vs. those who did not. We discovered that technical ability did not obviously associate with interview success, but the number of practice interviews people completed (either on interviewing.io or elsewhere) did. Surprisingly, no other factors we included in our model (seniority, gender, degree, etc.) mattered at all.\n\n**Secondly, technical interview performance from interview to interview is fairly inconsistent, even among strong candidates.** (Notably, consistency appears to have nothing to do with seniority, pedigree, or anything else.) **In fact,** [**only about 20% of interviewees perform consistently**](https://interviewing.io/blog/after-a-lot-more-data-technical-interview-performance-really-is-kind-of-arbitrary) **from interview to interview. Why does this matter? Once you\u2019ve done a few traditional technical interviews, you learn to account for and accept the volatility and lack of determinism in the process.** If you happen to have the benefit of speaking with friends who\u2019ve also been through it, it only gets easier. But what if you don\u2019t?\n\n## How the interview practice gap hurts underrepresented groups the most\n\nIn an earlier post, we wrote about how [women quit interview practice 7 times more often than men](https://interviewing.io/blog/voice-modulation-gender-technical-interviews) after just one bad interview. Unfortunately, this is likely affecting other underrepresented and underserved groups as well.\n\n**This is a broken process for everyone, but the flaws within the system hit these groups the hardest\u2014and simply because they haven\u2019t had the opportunity to internalize exactly how much of technical interviewing is a game.**\n\nSo what does this have to do with the practice gap? The key takeaway from our research has shown that there is **a meaningful bump in performance** (almost 2X as likely to pass!) **for candidates who have completed at least 5 practice interviews.** This isn\u2019t a lot of interviews for someone who\u2019s actively practicing and knows how the interview prep game works. But it\u2019s a far cry from what companies who are looking to boost their diversity numbers offer their candidates, and it\u2019s equally far from what bootcamps, an increasingly important source of candidates from underrepresented backgrounds, provide their students.\n\nWhy are bootcamps, universities, and employers all falling short and exacerbating the practice gap? With employers and bootcamps, the teams responsible for facilitating interview info sessions or mock interviews typically have non-technical backgrounds and lack a good grasp of the significant differences between preparing for behavioral interviews and technical ones.\n\nPreparing for technical interviews (and other analytical, domain-specific interviews) is more similar to studying for a math test than rehearsing how to present yourself and tell your story. But until you\u2019ve done it, you won\u2019t really get it.\n\nThe worst effect of the practice gap occurs when companies simply walk away from their expanded recruiting efforts, with the mistaken belief that they should return to recruiting exclusively from elite institutions. Or worse, they sometimes have their unconscious biases about race and/or gender confirmed, when the actual problem isn\u2019t the candidates but their lack of access to practice.\n\nIn fact, a few years ago, we ran a study where we looked at interview performance by school tier. For students who were actively and regularly practicing, [there was no difference between elite schools and non-elite schools](https://interviewing.io/blog/we-looked-at-how-a-thousand-college-students-performed-in-technical-interviews-to-see-if-where-they-went-to-school-mattered-it-didnt)!\n\n![Charts showing new grad interview performance by school tier](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FNew_Grad_Interview_Performance_by_School_Tier_b85571f044.png&w=1080&q=75 \"New Grad Interview Performance by School Tier\")\n\n## How to actually increase representation\n\nSo far I\u2019ve outlined my three main problems with diversity hiring initiatives\u2014but what\u2019s the solution? A few things:\n\n### Stop over-indexing on resumes\n\nIn this brave new world, where we have the technology to write code together remotely, and where we can collect data and reason about it, technology has the power to free us from relying on proxies, so that we can look at each individual as an indicative, unique bundle of performance-based data points. At interviewing.io, we make it possible to move away from proxies by looking at each interviewee as a collection of data points that tell a story, rather than a largely signal-less document a recruiter looks at for 10 seconds and then makes a largely arbitrary decision before moving on to the next candidate.\n\nOf course, this post lives on our blog, so I\u2019ll take a moment to plug what we do. In a world where there\u2019s a growing credentialing gap and where it\u2019s really hard to figure out how to separate a mediocre non-traditional candidate from a stellar one, we can help. interviewing.io helps companies find and hire engineers based on ability, not pedigree. We give out free mock interviews to engineers, and we use the data from these interviews to identify top performers, independently of how they look on paper. Those top performers then get to interview anonymously with employers on our platform (we\u2019ve hired for Lyft, Uber, Dropbox, Quora, and many other great, high-bar companies). And this system works. Not only are our candidates\u2019 conversion rates 3X the industry standard (about 70% of our candidates ace their phone screens, as compared to 20-25% in a typical, high-performing funnel), about 40% of the hires made by top companies on our platform have come from non-traditional backgrounds. Because of our completely anonymous, skills-first approach, we\u2019ve seen an interesting phenomenon happen time and time again: when an engineer unmasks at the end of a successful interview, the company in question realizes that the student who just aced their phone screen was one whose resume was sitting at the bottom of the pile all along (we recently had someone get hired after having been rejected by that same company 3 times based on his resume!).\n\nFrankly, think of how much time and money you\u2019re wasting competing for only a small pool of superficially qualified candidates when you could be hiring overlooked talent that\u2019s actually qualified. Your CFO will be happier, and so will your engineers. Look, whether you use us or something else, there\u2019s a slew of tech-enabled solutions that are redefining credentialing in engineering, from asynchronous coding assessments like CodeSignal or HackerRank to solutions that help you vet your inbound candidate pool, like Karat.\n\nAnd using these new tools isn\u2019t just paying lip service to a long-suffering D&I initiative. It gets you the candidates that everyone in the world isn\u2019t chasing without compromising on quality, helps you make more hires faster, and just makes hiring fairer across the board. And, yes, it will also help you meet your diversity goals.\n\n### Stop paying for unconscious bias training, and spend that budget on interview practice for your candidates\n\nAs you saw above, interview practice is absolutely key to success in technical interviews, but access to practice is not equitably distributed. I contend that tech giants, universities, and bootcamps could close the practice gap, level the playing field in software engineering, and hit our representation goals by simply providing candidates who need them with five professional mock interviews each. Hell, we would do it ourselves if we had the means. Yes, this will cost a few hundred dollars per candidate, but compared to the cost of sourcing and interviewing them, it\u2019s a small change.\n\nMoreover, if you\u2019re spending a significant amount of money on initiatives like unconscious bias training, [which has been shown to be ineffective](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/gender-equality/focusing-on-what-works-for-workplace-diversity), you could make a much bigger impact by shifting that budget toward interview practice for your candidates.\n\nIf you\u2019re an employer, [reach out to us](mailto:hello@interviewing.io) so we can help you make this a reality.\n\nWhether you only do some of these things, and whether you do them with us or with other tools and products, let\u2019s stop simply talking about how we need to fix representation in tech and instead do something that actually makes a difference. We can fix the diversity hiring initiatives that have failed us and ensure that the best people actually get hired.\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

Here\u2019s the data.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published: February 16, 2016; Last updated: March 28, 2024\n\n*Note: Though I wrote most of the words in this post, there are a few people outside of interviewing.io whose work made it possible. **[Ian Johnson](https://twitter.com/enjalot)**, creator of [d3 Building Blocks](http://blockbuilder.org/), created the graph entitled Standard Dev vs. Mean of Interviewee Performance (the one with the icons) as well as all the interactive visualizations that go with it. **[Dave Holtz](https://twitter.com/daveholtz)** did all the stats work for computing the probability of people failing individual interviews. You can see more about his work on [his blog](https://daveholtz.net/).*\n\n[interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/) is a platform where people can practice technical interviewing anonymously and, in the process, find jobs. In the past few months, we\u2019ve amassed data from hundreds of interviews, and **when we looked at how the same people performed from interview to interview, we were really surprised to find quite a bit of volatility, which, in turn, made us question the reliability of single interview outcomes.**\n\n## The setup\n\nWhen an interviewer and an interviewee match on our platform, they meet in a collaborative coding environment with voice[1](#user-content-fn-1), text chat, and a whiteboard and jump right into a technical question. Interview questions on the platform tend to fall into the category of what you\u2019d encounter at a phone screen for a back-end software engineering role, and interviewers typically come from a mix of large companies like Google, Facebook, and Yelp, as well as engineering-focused startups like Asana, Mattermark, KeepSafe, and more. If you\u2019d like to see an interview an action, head over to our [public recordings](https://interviewing.io/mocks) page for a few examples.\n\nAfter every interview, interviewers rate interviewees on a few different dimensions, including technical ability. Technical ability gets rated on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 is \u201cmeh\u201d and 4 is \u201camazing!\u201d ([you can see the feedback form here](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/49613_interviewer_feedback_64893c98f9.png)). On our platform, a score of 3 or above has generally meant that the person was good enough to move forward.\n\nAt this point, you might say, that\u2019s nice and all, but what\u2019s the big deal? Lots of companies collect this kind of data in the context of their own pipelines. Here\u2019s the thing that makes our data special: **the same interviewee can do multiple interviews, each of which is with a different interviewer and/or different company, and this opens the door for some pretty interesting and somewhat controlled comparative analysis**.\n\n## Performance from interview to interview is pretty volatile\n\nLet\u2019s start with some visuals. In the graph below, every tiny human icon represents the mean technical score for an individual interviewee who has done 2 or more interviews on the platform.[2](#user-content-fn-2) The y-axis is standard deviation of performance, so the higher up you go, the more volatile interview performance becomes. If you hover over each , you can drill down and see how that person did in each of their interviews. Anytime you see bolded text with a dotted underline, you can hover over it to see relevant data viz. Try it now to expand everyone\u2019s performance. You can also hover over the labels along the x-axis to drill into the performance of people whose means fall into those buckets.\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Clean_Shot_2022_12_22_at_11_45_36_2x_9d9ce0d21d.png)\n\nAs you can see, roughly 25% of interviewees are consistent in their performance, and the rest are all over the place.[3](#user-content-fn-3) If you look at the graph above, despite the noise, you can probably make some guesses about which people you\u2019d want to interview. **However, keep in mind that each represents a *mean*. Let\u2019s pretend that, instead, you had to make a decision based on just one data point. That\u2019s where things get dicey.** For instance:\n\n- Many people who scored at least one 4 also scored at least one 2.\n- If we look at high performers (mean of 3.3 or higher), we still see a fair amount of variation.\n- Things get really murky when we consider \u201caverage\u201d performers (mean between 2.6 and 3.3).\n\n**To me, looking at this data and then pretending that I had to make a hiring decision based on one interview outcome felt a lot like peering into some beautiful, lavishly appointed parlor through a keyhole.** Sometimes you see a piece of art on the wall, sometimes you see the liquor selection, and sometimes you just see the back of the couch.\n\nAt this point you might say that it\u2019s erroneous and naive to compare raw technical scores to one another for any number of reasons, not the least of which is that one interviewer\u2019s 4 is another interviewer\u2019s 2. We definitely share this concern and address it in the appendix of this post. It does bear mentioning, though, that most of our interviewers are coming from companies with strong engineering brands and that correcting for brand strength didn\u2019t change interviewee performance volatility, nor did correcting for interviewer rating.\n\nSo, in a real life situation, when you\u2019re trying to decide whether to advance someone to onsite, you\u2019re probably trying to avoid two things \u2014 false positives (bringing in people below your bar by mistake) and false negatives (rejecting people who should have made it in). Most top companies\u2019 interviewing paradigm is that false negatives are less bad than false positives. This makes sense right? With a big enough pipeline and enough resources, even with a high false negative rate, you\u2019ll still get the people you want. With a high false positive rate, you might get cheaper hiring, but you do potentially irreversible damage to your product, culture, and future hiring standards in the process. And of course, the companies setting the hiring standards and practices for an entire industry ARE the ones with the big pipelines and seemingly inexhaustible resources.\n\nThe dark side of optimizing for high false negative rates, though, rears its head in the form of our current engineering hiring crisis. Do single interview instances, in their current incarnation, give enough signal? Or amidst so much demand for talent, are we turning away qualified people because we\u2019re all looking at a large, volatile graph through a tiny keyhole?\n\nSo, hyperbolic moralizing aside, **given how volatile interview performance is, what are the odds that a good candidate will fail an individual phone screen?**\n\n## Odds of failing a single interview based on past performance\n\nBelow, you can see the distribution of mean performance throughout our population of interviewees.\n\nIn order to figure out the probability that a candidate with a given mean score would fail an interview, we had to do some stats work. First, we broke interviewees up into cohorts based on their mean scores (rounded to the nearest 0.25). Then, for each cohort, we calculated the probability of failing, i.e. of getting a score of 2 or less. Finally, to work around our starting data set not being huge, we [resampled](https://www.burns-stat.com/documents/tutorials/the-statistical-bootstrap-and-other-resampling-methods-2/) our data. In our resampling procedure, we treated an interview outcome as a multinomial distribution, or in other words, pretended that each interview was a roll of a weighted, 4-sided die corresponding to that candidate\u2019s cohort. We then re-rolled the dice a bunch of times to create a new, \u201csimulated\u201d dataset for each cohort and calculated new probabilities of failure for each cohort using these data sets. Below, you can see the results of repeating this process 10,000 times.\n\nAs you can see, a lot of the distributions above overlap with one another. This is important because these overlaps tell us that there may not be statistically significant differences between those groups (e.g. between 2.75 and 3). Certainly, with the advent of LOT more data, the delineations between cohorts may become clearer. On the other hand, if we do need a huge amount of data to detect differences in failure rate, it might suggest that people *are* intrinsically highly variable in their performance. **At the end of the day, while we can confidently say that there is a significant difference between the bottom end of the spectrum (2.25) versus the top end (3.75), for people in the middle, things are murky.**\n\nNevertheless, using these distributions, we did attempt to compute the probability that a candidate with a certain mean score would fail a single interview (see below \u2014 the shaded areas encapsulate a 95% confidence interval). The fact that people who are overall pretty strong (e.g. mean ~= 3) can mess up technical interviews as much as 22% of the time shows that there\u2019s definitely room for improvement in the process, and this is further exacerbated by the general murkiness in the middle of the spectrum.\n\n\n\n---\n\nGenerally, when we think of interviewing, we think of something that ought to have repeatable results and carry a strong signal. However, the data we\u2019ve collected, meager though it might be, tells a different story. And it resonates with both my anecdotal experience as a recruiter and with the sentiments we\u2019ve seen echoed in the community. Zach Holman\u2019s [Startup Interviewing is Fucked](https://zachholman.com/posts/startup-interviewing-is-fucked/) hits on the disconnect between interview process and the job it\u2019s meant to fill, the fine gentlemen of TripleByte [reached similar conclusions](https://triplebyte.com/blog/who-y-combinator-companies-want) by looking at their own data, and one of the more poignant expressions of inconsistent interviewing results recently came from [rejected.us](https://rejected.us/).\n\nYou can bet that many people who are rejected after a phone screen by Company A but do better during a different phone screen and ultimately end up somewhere traditionally reputable are getting hit up by Company A\u2019s recruiters 6 months later. And despite everyone\u2019s best efforts, the murky, volatile, and ultimately stochastic circle jerk of a recruitment process marches on.\n\nSo yes, it\u2019s certainly one possible conclusion is that technical interviewing itself is indeed fucked and doesn\u2019t provide a reliable, deterministic signal for one interview instance. Algorithmic interviews are a hotly debated topic and one we\u2019re deeply interested in teasing apart. One thing in particular we\u2019re very excited about is tracking interview performance as a function of interview type, as we get more and more different interviewing types/approaches happening on the platform. Indeed, one of our long-term goals is to really dig into our data, look at the landscape of different interview styles, and make some serious data-driven statements about what types of technical interviews lead to the highest signal.\n\n**In the meantime, however, I am leaning toward the idea that drawing on aggregate performance is much more meaningful than a making such an important decision based on one single, arbitrary interview.** Not only can aggregative performance help correct for an uncharacteristically poor performance, but it can also weed out people who eventually do well in an interview by chance or those who, over time, submit to the beast and memorize *Cracking the Coding Interview*. I know it\u2019s not always practical or possible to gather aggregate performance data in the wild, but at the very least, in cases where a candidate\u2019s performance is borderline or where their performance differs wildly from what you\u2019d expect, it might make sense to interview them one more time, perhaps focusing on slightly different material, before making the final decision.\n\n## Appendix: The part where we tentatively justify using raw scores for comparative performance analysis\n\nFor the skeptical, inquiring minds among you who realize that using raw coding scores to evaluate an interviewee has some pretty obvious problems, we\u2019ve included this section. The issue is that even though our interviewers tend to come from companies with high engineering bars, raw scores are still comprised of just one piece of feedback, they don\u2019t adjust for interviewer strictness (e.g. one interviewer\u2019s 4 could be another interviewer\u2019s 2), and they don\u2019t adjust well to changes in skill over time. Internally, we actually use a more complex and comprehensive rating system when determining skill, and if we can show that raw scores align with the ratings we calculate, then we don\u2019t feel so bad about using raw scores comparatively.\n\nOur rating system works something like this:\n\n1. We create a single score for each interview based on a weighted average of each feedback item.\n2. For each interviewer, we pit all the interviewees they\u2019ve interviewed against one another using this score.\n3. We use a Bayesian ranking system (a modified version of [Glicko-2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glicko2)) to generate a rating for each interviewee based on the outcome of these competitions.\n\nAs a result, each person is only rated based on their score as it compares to other people who were interviewed by the same interviewer. That means one interviewer\u2019s score is never directly compared to another\u2019s, and so we can correct for the hairy issue of inconsistent interviewer strictness.\n\nSo, why am I bringing this up at all? You\u2019re all smart people, and you can tell when someone is waving their hands around and pretending to do math. Before we did all this analysis, we wanted to make sure that we believed our own data. We\u2019ve done a lot of work to build a ratings system we believe in, so we correlated that with raw coding scores to see how strong they are at determining actual skill.\n\nThese results are pretty strong. Not strong enough for us to rely on raw scores exclusively but strong enough to believe that raw scores are useful for determining approximate candidate strength.\n\n*Thanks to Andrew Marsh for co-authoring the appendix, to [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) for making a terrific graphing product, and to everyone who read drafts of this behemoth.*\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. While listening to interviews day in and day out, I came up with a drinking game. Every time someone thinks the answer is hash table, take a drink. And every time the answer actually is hash table, take two drinks.[4](#user-content-fn-4) [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-1)\n2. This is data as of January 2016, and there are only 299 interviews because not all interviews have enough feedback data and because we threw out everyone with less than 2 interviews. Moreover, one thing we don\u2019t show in this graph is the passage of time, so you can [see people\u2019s performance over time](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~aline_interviewingio/858/interviewee-performance-over-time-299-interviews-w-67-interviewees/?share_key=JFfMkYzESYN6gMH2E7vlJC) \u2014 it\u2019s kind of a hot mess. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-2)\n3. We were curious to see if volatility varied at all with people\u2019s mean scores. In other words, were weaker players more volatile than strong ones? The answer is no \u2014 when we ran a regression on standard deviation vs. mean, we couldn\u2019t come up with any meaningful relationship (R-squared ~= 0.03), which means that people are all over the place regardless of how strong they are on average. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-3)\n4. I almost died. [\u21a9](#user-content-fnref-4)\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

Our advice is applicable to everyone, but I wrote this post primarily to share with interviewing.io\u2019s user base, so that future clients of our negotiation service don\u2019t shoot themselves in the foot.\n\nThese are the two things you **must** avoid. Both involve how you talk to recruiters at the start of your job search, way before there\u2019s an offer:\n\n1. Revealing information too early in the game\n2. Negotiating before you\u2019re ready\n\nIn this post, I\u2019ll explain why these two mistakes routinely sabotage salary negotiation efforts and what to say to recruiters instead. In a nutshell, if you can just be in \u201cpassive information gathering\u201d mode (more on that later) for most of your recruiter interactions, you\u2019ll be golden. It\u2019s hard to not to share info about your job search with your recruiter, especially as you build more rapport with them, but we\u2019ll tell you exactly what to say instead.\n\nBefore we get into all of that, I want to go over two foundational things about negotiation.\n\n1. Recruiters are not your friend, and they don't work for you.\n2. What negotiation is and what it\u2019s not\n\n## Recruiters are not your friend, and they don\u2019t work for you\n\n*\u201cIt is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.*\u201d   \n-Upton Sinclair\n\nI used to be a recruiter. I ran my own agency, and I also worked in-house before starting interviewing.io. That means that I\u2019ve had to [struggle with the tangled incentive structure that comes with being a recruiter](https://blog.alinelerner.com/if-youre-an-engineer-who-wants-to-start-a-recruiting-business-read-this-first) (see the section called \u201cYou should write down your principles\u201d). There\u2019s always a tension \u2014 recruiters are, by and large, good human beings who genuinely want to help their candidates, but they also have an employer they\u2019re beholden to, as well as a comp/bonus structure that rewards certain behaviors, some of which run counter to candidates\u2019 best interests.\n\nThere\u2019s some distinction between in-house recruiters and third-party recruiters (recruiters who work for an agency that does placement, rather than a specific company that\u2019s hiring engineers).\n\n### Third party recruiters\n\nMy general policy with third-party recruiters is to not tell them ANYTHING and to always deal directly with the companies they introduce you, once you establish a point of contact there. You should assume that anything you tell your recruiter is going to get back to every company you\u2019re working with. Why? Because their primary objective is to place your butt in the seat of one of the companies they\u2019re working with, and they will do whatever they need to do to make the deal happen. Often, those things will run counter to your interests.\n\nA big misconception that many candidates labor under is the idea that because third-party recruiters get paid every time they make a placement, their interests are fundamentally aligned. At a high level, this is kind of true, but once you dig into the details you'll see a lot of nuance.\n\nA recruiter, depending on market conditions, gets anywhere from 8%-25% of the candidate\u2019s base salary when they make a placement. In the current climate, it\u2019s around 10%. However, that cut is going to the recruiting agency as a whole rather than to the individual recruiter \u2014 you will almost always end up working with large agencies rather than a sole-proprietor shop where the owner gets to take all of it home.\n\nLet's say that you get an offer with a base salary of $150,000. You talk to your third-party recruiter and tell them that you would like more money. The recruiter may go to the hiring manager and try to advocate for you, but they're not going to push very hard because the incremental difference in their cut is going to be pretty small and to them the thing that matters most is getting butts in seats. After all, they're evaluated on the number of hires they make, first and foremost, independent of comp. Understanding that, let's do the math anyway. Say that they\u2019re able to risk closing the deal and get you $165k. Before, the agency would have gotten paid $15k. Now the agency gets paid $16.5k. That incremental $1.5k isn\u2019t worth risking a deal over (even a few thousand dollars would not justify jeopardizing the deal). On top of that, the individual recruiter is only going to maybe get a few hundred dollars total from that increase. So for them the difference really isn\u2019t worth it. **Third party recruiters are incentivized to get the deal done, not to risk the deal by negotiating hard for you.**\n\nMoreover, because they\u2019re incentivized to get the deal done, you should assume that your recruiter will share anything you share with them with the company or companies they\u2019ve introduced you to. If you tell them that a company is your first choice and that you\u2019re tempted to accept, they will likely share that with the company and may even recommend that they not raise your comp, since you\u2019re already so enthusiastic. If you share that you\u2019re not very interested in a company, and the recruiter has other candidates they\u2019re presenting, they will prioritize those candidates\u2019 experience over yours and will possibly tell the company not to invest in you as hard.\n\n### In-house recruiters\n\nWhat about in-house recruiters? In-house recruiters may or may not get a bonus for hires that happen on their watch; it depends on the company. But if they do, that bonus is generally NOT tied to your compensation, and in some cases, they may get a bigger bonus if they\u2019re able to negotiate you down. At big companies, in particular, in-house recruiters follow a playbook. They\u2019re trained to make offers within specific bands, and they\u2019re trained to mobilize such that they don\u2019t lose candidates to other big companies \u2014 if you wave a Facebook counteroffer in front of Google, they will act. If you tell them you\u2019re interviewing at a startup, they will not, because they know that startups don\u2019t pay as much. They\u2019re actually evaluated on how well they follow the playbook. Because of that, there is no reason to assume that their incentives align with yours. They\u2019re incentivized, first and foremost, to follow the rules their head of department sets for them. This is true for how they evaluate candidates, who they let through, and how they read resumes. And it\u2019s definitely true for how they negotiate.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in peeking behind the curtain on how recruiters think, I interviewed three of the best ones in the industry recently. You can watch that below:\n\n  \nI\u2019ll close this section the way I began it. Recruiters want to help, and many are rooting for their candidates. But they\u2019re also operating inside a box, and that box isn\u2019t set up to put your interests first.\n  \n\n## What negotiation is and what it\u2019s not\n\nProbably because of bad books and airplane magazine ads (for those of you old enough to remember those), people often think that negotiation is all about saying the right thing, or how firm your handshake is, or any other amount of silly nonsense. **The reality is that negotiation is all about preparation and leverage.**\n\nDon't forget to prepare for your technical interviews too. Sign up today for anonymous mocks with senior engineers from top companies.\n\n[See available times](https://interviewing.io/signup)\n\n![](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcta.47351a0d.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nPreparation and leverage means doing the work to make sure that you have multiple offers, that all your offers come in at the same time, and that you don\u2019t tip your hand too early. Laying this foundation is 80% of the work. You\u2019ll need to slow some companies down, speed some companies up, and hold off questions from recruiters until you\u2019re ready to negotiate, and not before. If you do this right, the actual negotiation part will be easy and almost a foregone conclusion.\n\nIs it possible to negotiate when you don\u2019t have multiple offers and when you haven\u2019t done the foundational work? Sure, it is, and we\u2019ve sometimes had success with our users doing that. But it\u2019s much harder, and the ceiling on how much more money you can get is lower.\n\nWith all that out the way, let\u2019s talk about how the two biggest mistakes people make and how to not make them!\n\n## Mistake #1: Revealing information before you\u2019re ready to negotiate\n\nYou\u2019ve probably never been arrested, but if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve watched a lot of police procedurals on TV. You know the bit where they read the suspect their Miranda rights? They start like this:\n\n*You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law\u2026*\n\nTalking to recruiters is exactly the same, and one of the biggest mistakes we see our users make is sharing information too early. This is generally the only mistake we can\u2019t walk back \u2014 once you share information, you can\u2019t undo it, and sharing information actually has no upside, only downside. When you\u2019re ready to negotiate, you\u2019re doing so deliberately because you already *know*\nthe state of the world, and you\u2019re choosing to reveal the parts that set you up for success. Before that, you\u2019re just revealing stuff that can be used against you.\n\n**Specifically, do not share with recruiters anything about your salary history (though it\u2019s illegal in many states to ask this directly, there are indirect ways of asking, and many still do), your salary expectations, where else you\u2019re interviewing, and how far along in the process you are with other companies. In short, don\u2019t share any information about money or other interviews.**\n\nThe main question recruiters ask up front about money is: \u201cWhat are your compensation expectations?\u201d They claim that it\u2019s because they want to make sure that you\u2019re not so far off in your expectations that interviewing with that company would be a waste of time. This is a nonsense reason \u2014 *very few* companies pay so much below market that it would be a nonstarter. Those companies know who they are, and they know to give you a heads up that they pay below market. Moreover, with the recent advent of companies sharing salary bands, you\u2019ll have some idea if they're grossly below market before you interview. The real reason recruiters ask about compensation expectations is so that they can use it against you later in negotiations.\n\nAs such, if you answer this question with a number, you set an artificial ceiling on your offer. Do not even utter a single number to a recruiter until you\u2019re ready to bargain. Do not go on levels.fyi and comment on the ranges listed for your level, even if you\u2019re currently underpaid and an average offer from them would be life changing. **Do not say a number first \u2014 ever.**\n\nYou can see exactly what to say when you get asked about compensation expectations in the section called \u201cHow to handle recruiter calls\u201d below.\n\nThe most obvious way to lose leverage is revealing information about money. The other way to lose leverage is by sharing information about where else you\u2019re interviewing. If you share this information, you risk prematurely scaring off smaller companies because they don\u2019t think they can win in a bidding war with FAANG. You also risk cornering yourself into a situation where the company knows your options are limited, and they might be inclined to lowball you as a result. Finally, you risk getting an exploding offer to try to force you to make a decision before you\u2019re ready.\n\nBelow are some examples that I hope will drive these points home.\n\n### Example #1: You\u2019re interviewing at Google, Meta, and two startups\n\nLet\u2019s say that you\u2019re currently interviewing at Google, Meta, and two startups (let\u2019s call them A and B). You\u2019re at the onsite stage with Google, you\u2019re doing technical phone screens at both startups, and you\u2019re just doing your first recruiter call with Meta. This is actually a very strong position to be in!\n\nOf course, your Meta recruiter asks you about your comp expectations and where else you\u2019re interviewing.\n\n**If you reveal your comp expectations, it will be hard to walk them back:**\n\n- Let\u2019s say that you currently work at a startup and make $150k in cash with some amount of equity. You go to levels.fyi or a similar site and look up Facebook\u2019s salary bands for the role you\u2019re targeting. Let\u2019s say those bands for total comp are $250k-$350k. Hell, that\u2019s way more cash than you\u2019re making now, so you decide to share that range, thinking that if those are their bands already, it does no harm. That\u2019s reasonable, except that let\u2019s say Google ends up making you an offer, and it\u2019s $400k (we\u2019ve seen this scenario happen to a bunch of our users). Now you have to walk back what you said, in which case your recruiter will invariably ask why. And now you have to reveal, before you\u2019re ready, that you have a Google offer, which means you\u2019ll probably end up revealing that it\u2019s for $400k. Now you\u2019ve set an artificial ceiling for your Facebook counteroffer to be $400k as well, when in reality that ceiling may have been closer to $450k or even $500k.\n\n**If you reveal that you\u2019re at the onsite stage with Google and talking to some startups, here's what will happen:**\n\n- Your recruiter will do the math and start asking you in a few weeks if you got to team matching.\n- Now Meta knows that Google is the only possible offer on the table that they should be worried about. They (and other big companies) don\u2019t take startup offers nearly as seriously because equity is monopoly money 'til it\u2019s not\u2026 and even if you don\u2019t reveal the cash portion of your comp, they\u2019ll assume it\u2019s smaller than what they\u2019re offering.\n- If you didn\u2019t pass the onsite, it\u2019s going to be hard to not share that when you\u2019re persistently asked about it, unless you lie (which I absolutely do not condone). Now you\u2019ve lost leverage because Meta knows that you cannot possibly have any other big tech company offers.\n- If you DO perform well in your Google onsite, that\u2019s great, but team matching can take a while (yes, I know Google is changing their process such that you\u2019re now interviewing for a specific team at the outset, but the broader point still stands). So now if Meta is about to make you an offer, they can set an artificially fast expiration date to run out the clock.\n\n**Though you started in a strong position with multiple interviews, including at companies that are known to pay well, you\u2019ve now weakened that position by sharing details.**\n\nHere\u2019s another thing that could happen in this scenario. Let\u2019s say that it\u2019s the same set of companies as above, but this time you\u2019re talking to the recruiter from startup A. The recruiter asks you where else you\u2019re interviewing.\n\n**If you mention that you\u2019re interviewing at both Google and Meta, they might get spooked.**\n\n- I\u2019ve seen this happen a bunch. Dropping FAANG names can be a good power move, or it can shoot you in the foot, and which it\u2019ll be really depends on the situation. Many small startups view FAANG candidates as risky because they know they can\u2019t compete on comp and are worried that you\u2019re going to walk the moment that you get a FAANG offer. This may or may not be true (not everyone is motivated just by comp!), but it\u2019s not to your advantage to reveal it. YOU should be in control of if and when we play the FAANG card.\n\n### Example #2: You\u2019re interviewing at one company and are also up for a promotion\n\nHere\u2019s a different example. Let\u2019s say that you work at a startup, and you\u2019re up for a promotion soon. You figured it\u2019d make sense to see what\u2019s out there as well, so you\u2019ve started interviewing with another startup.\n\nYour recruiter asks you in your first call about where else you\u2019re interviewing and what your comp expectations are. You may be tempted to mention that you\u2019re up for a promotion because that feels like it\u2019ll give you leverage \u2014 if you get a promotion, the startup will have to work harder to entice you to leave, after all. Not so fast!\n\n**If you mention that you\u2019re up for a promotion:**\n\n- Your recruiter will start checking in consistently on whether you got it. Promotions always take longer than you think, and the increase in your comp may not be what you expect. At some point, if you haven\u2019t gotten it yet, the recruiter will assume it\u2019s not coming, and then you actually lose leverage because they know that you\u2019re going to be more likely to walk.\n\n**If you mention that you\u2019re not interviewing anywhere else, that\u2019s just a giveaway that you have no leverage:**\n\n- Promotion or not, many of our users assume that they have leverage because, \u201cI don\u2019t have to leave my job, so my current job is leverage.\u201d That\u2019s not true, though \u2014 even in this climate, and definitely in a hiring boom, an engineer having another job is table stakes. Almost every candidate you\u2019re competing with will be currently employed. So even if having a job gives you a little bit of leverage, it gets canceled out when everyone has the same exact thing.\n\nThe details may differ in your case, but the fundamental mechanics are the same. When you reveal information before you know what hand you\u2019ve been dealt, it can only hurt you. I\u2019m struggling to think of a scenario where revealing something has been beneficial.\n\nI suppose the one exception to revealing information is this: Sometimes it can be useful to give your recruiter a rough estimate for when you\u2019ll be collecting offers, e.g., \u201cI\u2019ve just started interviewing. I expect to get through all my interviews and onsites in the next 6 weeks and start collecting offers 2 months from now. Does that timeline work for you?\u201d\n\nThis technique can be helpful for aligning expectations up front and then keeping recruiters off your back, as they won\u2019t need to chronically text you to make sure you haven\u2019t taken another offer yet (we\u2019ll talk more about texting with recruiters in the next section). But note that even in this example, we\u2019re not actually revealing any information about where you\u2019re interviewing, how long it\u2019s taking, or compensation. You\u2019re just setting a timeline based on *hypotheticals* without giving out any details that can be used against you later. When you share the actual timeline you\u2019re working with, you no longer control the timing of your job search, and a huge part of negotiation is controlling timing so you can make all your offers come in at the same time.\n\n## Mistake #2: Premature negotiation\n\n*\u201cDon't fire until you see the whites of their eyes!*\u201d  \n-Unknown officer at the Battle of Bunker Hill\n\nJust like not revealing information too early, you also want to avoid negotiating too early. They\u2019re two sides of the same coin.\n\nThink of it like a hand of cards. At the beginning, you have no idea what you\u2019re going to draw. The longer you wait to negotiate, assuming you\u2019ve timed things correctly, the more information you have. Then, when you\u2019re ready to negotiate, you can look at your hand and selectively share information that puts you in the strongest position. For instance, if you have a high base salary from one company, a great equity package from a public company, and a signing bonus from a third company, you can strategically share those portions of the offers without sharing the weaker parts. Each negotiation is different, and it\u2019s hard to give catch-all advice, but that\u2019s generally the situation you should set yourself up to be in.\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019m a firm believer in negotiating when you\u2019re ready and not before. Until you know what else is on the table, it\u2019s really hard to 1) have the bravado that comes with actually having multiple offers (this is possible to fake, but trust me, it\u2019s hard) and 2) negotiate effectively \u2014 you will never know as well as your recruiter what salary bands are like, what market comp is, and so on. They do this all day. This may be your first or fifth time doing it, but there\u2019s massive experience and information asymmetry. There are two ways to combat this power imbalance: have as many of your interactions be asynchronous as possible (we discussed that earlier) and do everything you can to negotiate when you\u2019re at the point of maximum information, and not before. Daniel Biales, one of our former negotiation clients, [explained the latter really well](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/learn-how-to-negotiate-your-salary-with-expert-help-5afedd11a178).\n\n*When I received a low offer, my first inclination was to start the negotiating process. Aline helped me to realize that this was not the best course of action. The problem with this approach is that I wanted to start negotiating before receiving my highest offer. If I negotiated an increase then, I would have had to renegotiate when I received the higher offer. This will cause negotiating fatigue for you and the company. They will be less likely to negotiate a second time because they don\u2019t know how many times you will ask them for more. First, focus on strategies to draw out your decision. Then, when you have all your offers, start negotiating. There may be a couple of back and forth communications, but they will be over a short time span rather than drawn out.*\n\n### Example #1 revisited: You're interviewing at Google, Meta, and two startups\n\nLet\u2019s review our first example again. Imagine that you\u2019re interviewing at Google, Meta, and two startups, A and B, just like before. Startup A makes you an offer: $160k base, 0.1% of the company in options over four years, no signing bonus. You react to it and say that you were hoping for a signing bonus. The recruiter comes back with a $10k signing bonus quickly and pressures you to make a decision, saying that they have other candidates waiting.\n\nBy starting to negotiate, you accelerated their timeline, and this is going to make it hard to go back and ask for more signing bonus.\n\nYou try to stall, and then a few days later, Google makes you an offer that includes a $25k signing bonus. You\u2019re still excited about the startup for reasons other than compensation, but now you have to go back to them and say that you actually got a $25k signing bonus at Google. They are unlikely to move again.\n\nSo, don\u2019t negotiate until you\u2019re ready. It\u2019s hard to walk things back.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not possible to negotiate in stages and gradually start bringing up all your offers. In my experience, however, this is a much more difficult maneuver, takes way more experience, is much more stressful for the candidate, and often ends up with the same results as laying a solid foundation and just negotiating once at the end.\n\nSo what do you say when you get asked pointed questions by your recruiter about your comp expectations or where you\u2019re interviewing? And how do you delay negotiation until you\u2019re ready?\n\n## How to handle recruiter **calls:** \u201cpassive information gathering\u201d mode\n\nUntil you\u2019re ready to negotiate, your default mode should be \u201cpassive information gathering.\u201d This means that you listen rather than talk. I coach all of our negotiation clients to be in this mode when they get on a call with a recruiter.\n\n- **Be polite and gracious to a fault.** If it\u2019s an offer call, thank them for the work they did to put your offer together and for advocating for you. If it\u2019s earlier in the process, thank them for their help so far.\n- **Express genuine enthusiasm.** If it\u2019s an early call, express excitement about the company or the interview process if there\u2019s something idiosyncratically cool about it. If it\u2019s an offer call, express excitement for the team, the projects, the hiring manager, whatever it is. And be genuine. Every offer will have something exciting about it.\n- If the recruiter is making an offer, do not react to what you\u2019re being told beyond expressing enthusiasm. **Say that you need some time to process and/or talk to your {family, partner, spouse}.** Why should you not react? Because recruiters do this a lot, and you don\u2019t. Negotiating on the phone on the fly is really hard. You\u2019re going to need time to think, and you need a way to level the playing field. Email is the great leveler in these interactions because it\u2019s asynchronous, and it gives you time to think and plan. No one is realistically expecting you to react to major life decisions on the fly!\n- **Use email (not phone when possible and *DEFINITELY* not texts) to interact with recruiters. We strongly advise you to leave your phone number off your resume, and if you have to fill in any required phone number fields while applying, to put a Google voice number. Also, in your first conversation with your recruiter, let them know that you are very bad at using the phone and strongly prefer email. Finally, whenever they text or call, wait a few hours, and answer with email and remind them that email is the best way to reach you (you can always say that you don\u2019t have notifications enabled during work hours).** Why does all of this matter? Phone calls are extremely disruptive, as are texts. The only way to level the playing field in negotiation is to have time to think and to possibly ask for advice. In particular, the casual nature of texting lulls you into a false sense of security. Moreover, the fact that texts or phone calls interrupt you from something else puts you at a disadvantage \u2014 when you get interrupted, your instinct is to quickly respond to make the interruption go away. But knee-jerk responses are rarely the right ones, and you\u2019ll find yourself giving away information you shouldn\u2019t have. You will have to get on the phone eventually, of course, but you never have to text.\n- If a recruiter asks you pointed questions about comp expectations or where else you\u2019re interviewing, refer to the section called \u201cExactly what to say\u201d right below!\n\n## Exactly what to say\n\nIn all the snippets below, you\u2019ll notice that they end with the same sentence: *I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.*\n\nThis is deliberate, and it\u2019s there because it\u2019s disarming. Fundamentally, recruiters ask you all of these questions because they don\u2019t want to lose out on you and have you go to another company. If you can speak to that worry head-on, there\u2019s not much they can say back.\n\n**For questions about comp expectations at the beginning of the process:**   \n*At this point, I don\u2019t feel equipped to throw out a number because I\u2019d like to find out more about the opportunity first \u2013 right now, I simply don\u2019t have the data to be able to say something concrete. If you end up making me an offer, I would be more than happy to iterate on it if needed and figure out something that works. I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.*\n\n**For questions about comp expectations at the end of the process:**   \n*It sounds like there\u2019s an offer coming, and I\u2019m really excited about it. I\u2019m not sure exactly what number I\u2019m looking for, but if you\u2019d be able to share what an offer package might look like, then I will gladly iterate on it with you if needed and figure out something that works. I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.*\n\n**For questions about where else you\u2019re interviewing at the beginning of the process:**  \n*I\u2019m currently speaking with a few other companies and am at various stages with them. I\u2019ll let you know if I get to the point where I have an exploding offer, and I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.*\n\n**For questions about where else you\u2019re interviewing at the end of the process:**  \n*I\u2019m wrapping things up with a few companies and in process with a few more. I promise to keep you in the loop, and I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.*\n\n**For when a recruiter provides you a salary range and asks you to comment on it, at the beginning of the process:**  \n*Thank you for sharing that with me. Right now I don\u2019t know enough about the opportunity to value it concretely, and I honestly haven't done my market research. If you end up making me an offer, I would be more than happy to iterate on it if needed and figure out something that works.

Since last year, we\u2019ve also been running a [Fellowship program specifically for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds](https://interviewing.io/blog/announcing-the-interviewing-io-technical-interview-practice-fellowship).\n\nAll that is to say that even though I have strong opinions about \u201cdiversity hiring\u201d initiatives, I\u2019ve acquired them the honest way, through laboratory experience.\n\nThough I find it problematic to label any type of hiring as \u201cdiversity hiring\u201d \u2014primarily because it tacitly implies to candidates and everyone else involved that they are getting the job not because of their merits but because of their demographics or to fill some quota\u2014nomenclature is not my main critique of these initiatives. Though there are a number of big issues with how employers approach hiring, in this post I\u2019ll talk about the one that\u2019s at once the most subtle and the most damaging: **systematically ignoring the technical interview practice gap between traditional and non-traditional candidates**. I\u2019ll explain exactly what the interview practice gap is and why it\u2019s so bad in a moment, but first, allow me to tell you a little story.\n\n## The benefit of attending an elite CS university\n\nI was fortunate enough to attend MIT for undergrad. Probably the greatest gift that MIT gave me was a big stamp on my forehead that, to this day, makes strangers think I\u2019m smart. But there was another, more relevant gift that gave me a serious advantage over students who did not attend an elite computer science institution: boundless access to technical interview practice.\n\nNot only was there a multi-week course during the month-long break between Fall and Spring semesters that was dedicated exclusively to passing technical interviews, but all of my peers were going through exactly the same thing at the same time. Everyone was interviewing at FAANG for internships and new grad positions, which meant that we could all practice with each other, share our successes and failures, and, over time, internalize just how much of technical interviewing is a numbers game. **We learned that bombing a Google interview did not mean that you weren\u2019t meant to be an engineer. It just meant that you needed to work some more problems, do more mock interviews, and try again at Facebook.**\n\n## Practice, practice, practice\n\nMy anecdotal experience aside, we at interviewing.io have actual data. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve hosted close to 100K interviews on our platform. It has taught us two very important things. This interview style is controversial, in part because it\u2019s not entirely similar to the work software engineers do every day but also because 1) like standardized testing, it\u2019s a learned skill, and 2) unlike standardized testing, interview results are not consistent or repeatable\u2014the same candidate can do well in one interview and fail another one the same day.\n\n**First, regardless of how strong you are technically, practice really matters.** In a recent study, [we looked at how people who got jobs at FAANG performed](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-know-ready-interview-faang) in practice vs. those who did not. Below is a graph of average technical score in interviews and the portion of people with each score who passed Facebook\u2019s interview process.\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Clean_Shot_2022_12_16_at_19_21_52_2x_592c564655.png)\n\nYou can see that technical ability did not obviously associate with interview success. So what did? It turned out that the number of practice interviews people completed (either on interviewing.io or off) had a much bigger bearing, as you can see below. Surprisingly, no other factors we included in our model (seniority, gender, degree, etc.) mattered at all.\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Clean_Shot_2022_12_16_at_19_22_05_2x_1974c0c5ce.png)\n\n**Secondly, technical interview performance from interview to interview is fairly inconsistent, even among strong candidates.** Notably, as above, consistency appears to have nothing to do with seniority, pedigree, or anything else. **In fact, only about 20% of interviewees perform consistently from interview to interview. Why does this matter? Once you\u2019ve done a few traditional technical interviews, the volatility and lack of determinism in the process is something you figure out anecdotally and kind of accept.** And if you have the benefit of having friends who\u2019ve also been through it, it only gets easier. But what if you don\u2019t?\n\nIn a previous post, we talked about how [women quit interview practice 7 times more often than men](https://interviewing.io/blog/voice-modulation-gender-technical-interviews) after just one bad interview. It\u2019s not too much of a leap to say that this is probably happening to any number of groups who are underrepresented/underserved by the current system. **In other words, though it\u2019s a broken process for everyone, the flaws within the system hit these groups the hardest\u2014just because they haven\u2019t had the chance to internalize exactly how much of technical interviewing is a game.** Sadly, since we\u2019ve started running our Fellowship program for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds, we\u2019ve seen this effect firsthand.\n\n## The technical interview practice gap\n\nSo what does this have to do with the practice gap? As you can see in the graph above, **there was a pretty meaningful bump in performance** (almost 2X as likely to pass!) **after at least five practice interviews.** Five interviews is not a lot for someone who\u2019s actively practicing and knows how the interview prep game works. **But it\u2019s a far cry from what companies who are looking to boost their diversity numbers offer their candidates, and it\u2019s equally far from what bootcamps, an increasingly important source of candidates from underrepresented backgrounds, provide their students.**\n\n### What employers are doing wrong\n\nI won\u2019t name any specific companies here, but tech giants (many with good intentions and with marching orders to boost their diversity numbers) often do a considerable amount of outreach and pre-interview engagement with candidates from underrepresented backgrounds. This outreach is usually an info session where one engineer speaks to a virtual room of candidates from underrepresented backgrounds. The engineer tells them what to expect in technical interviews, encourages them to learn how to articulate their thought process out loud while solving a problem, and recommends resources like *Cracking the Coding Interview.* Some companies even go so far as to offer their underrepresented candidates a mock interview or two.\n\nUnfortunately, for candidates who are unfamiliar with the process, neither of these interventions is nearly enough.\n\n### What bootcamps are doing wrong\n\nBecause they\u2019re cheaper and much faster than a four-year program, bootcamps seem like a rational choice when compared to the price of attending a top university. Since 2013, bootcamp enrollment has grown 9X, with a total of 20,316 graduates in 2018. Though these numbers represent enrollment across all genders and the raw number of grads lags behind CS programs, the portion of women graduating from bootcamps is also on the rise and graduation from online programs has actually reached gender parity (as compared to only 20% in traditional CS programs).\n\nDespite these encouraging numbers, things start to go sideways when it\u2019s time for students to start interviewing for jobs, and disappointingly, what bootcamps provide their students isn\u2019t much better than the tech giants with good intentions.\n\nAgain, without naming names, I\u2019ve interacted in some capacity with almost every major bootcamp over the last few years, trying to sell them on providing interview practice for their students, and I\u2019ve also witnessed how recent bootcamp grads perform in mock interviews on interviewing.io. Based on these observations, bootcamps seem to have two big limitations: not nearly enough time spent on data structures and algorithms in the curriculum and lack of interview prep support both during and after the program.\n\nDiscussing bootcamp curriculum is out of the scope of this post, but I will say a few words about how bootcamps handle interview preparation. Bootcamps, by and large, have pretty thin margins and can\u2019t invest much in paying for interview prep or hiring engineers to do it. As such, if they do offer mock interviews with professionals, just like tech companies, they tend to cap them at one or two, which we know isn\u2019t nearly enough.\n\nIf they do not offer mock interviews with professionals (and most do NOT), they instead tend to focus on peer to peer practice (students interviewing other students), or they solicit volunteers from their pool of recent alums. While peer interviews are not entirely useless, they\u2019re a far cry from working with someone who knows what the interview process is like. For the price tag that bootcamps charge their students, it\u2019s appalling that they\u2019re unable to invest resources into the last mile: actually getting their students ready for interviews.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that bootcamp grads are not viable employees. If that were true, I wouldn\u2019t be advocating bootcamps as a means of increasing diversity in software engineering. What\u2019s heartbreaking is that bootcamp students have all the makings of good engineers\u2014they just need to spend an extra 3-6 months after graduation drilling by themselves on the skills their programs should have offered them.\n\nWhile I have less direct experience with curriculum and career centers at non-elite universities (another contributor to the practice gap), from speaking with students who attend these schools, it\u2019s clear that access to consistent interview prep is hard to come by, especially when compared to what\u2019s available at their more elite counterparts.\n\n## The cost of falling short\n\nWhy are bootcamps, universities, and employers all falling short and exacerbating the practice gap? With both employers and bootcamps, the teams responsible for facilitating interview info sessions or mock interviews typically consist of career coaches who don\u2019t come from a technical background and therefore don\u2019t have a good grasp of the difference between preparing for behavioral interviews and technical ones \u2026 and the big gulf between the two.\n\nBehavioral interviews aren\u2019t easy, sure, but they don\u2019t require you to get used to a completely different mode of communication while simultaneously solving hard problems and turning them into code as someone breathes down your neck. Nor do behavioral interviews require hours and hours of grinding and drilling.\n\nPreparing for technical interviews (and other analytical, domain-specific interviews\u2026 see the Tweet about management consulting below) is much more like studying for a math test than it is about practicing presenting yourself and telling your story. But until you\u2019ve done it, you won\u2019t really get it.\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Clean_Shot_2022_12_16_at_19_22_19_2x_5d1b0fcf7f.png)\n\nThe most heartbreaking effect of the practice gap is this. Companies, under fire for hiring exclusively from top schools, expand their recruiting efforts and start targeting a broader range of schools and programs. One of the boldest programs of this type interviewed every CS student at each HBCU to develop a pipeline of African American candidates. Sadly, because of the interview practice gap, good-intentioned programs like this are destined to fail. A 2016 piece in Bloomberg (\u201c[Why Doesn\u2019t Silicon Valley Hire Black Coders?](https://www.bloomberg.com/tosv2.html?vid=&uuid=324fb7d1-d308-11ed-a129-7179624d4b55&url=L2ZlYXR1cmVzLzIwMTYtaG93YXJkLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktY29kZXJzLw==)\u201d) covered this problem extensively:\n\n> *When they started interviewing seniors, companies found\u2014as Pratt did at Howard\u2014that many were underprepared. They hadn\u2019t been exposed to programming before college and had gaps in their college classes. The companies were coming into the process too late. So many of them have created programs geared toward freshmen and sophomores.*\n\n**Then, when the initiative inevitably fails, companies walk away with their conscious biases about the \u201csuperiority\u201d of top schools confirmed. Or even worse, this confirms their unconscious biases about race and/or gender, when the real problem isn\u2019t the students but their lack of access to interview practice.**\n\n## How you can (actually!) help\n\nA few years ago, we ran a study that examined interview performance by school tier. Among students who were actively and regularly practicing technical interviewing, [there was no difference in performance between elite schools and non-elite schools](https://interviewing.io/blog/we-looked-at-how-a-thousand-college-students-performed-in-technical-interviews-to-see-if-where-they-went-to-school-mattered-it-didnt)!\n\n![Chart showing new grad interview performance by school tier](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fnew_grad_interview_performance_008804d4ed.png&w=1920&q=75 \"New Grad Interview Performance by School Tier\")\n\nAll that is to say that **with at least 5 professional mock interviews per candidate, we could close the practice gap, level the playing field in software engineering, and hit our representation goals.** This is a bold statement, but in my decade plus of operating in this space, I have not seen anything as effective at closing the gap in tech as getting everyone technical interview practice. If you\u2019re an employer, I urge you to consider the following:\n\n- **Create a program where you sponsor interview practice for your candidates**, especially those who aren\u2019t socialized in technical interviews. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s through interviewing.io or through someone else. Just do it.\n- One mock interview is not enough. An info session is not enough. **You need at least five interviews to move the needle**, and they need to happen systematically and on a schedule. But you know what? It\u2019s a few hundred dollars per candidate. Compared to the cost of sourcing and interviewing them, it\u2019s peanuts.\n- You may want to think about routing some of your D&I budget toward this purpose. **If you\u2019re spending any appreciable amount of money on initiatives like unconscious bias training**, [which has been shown over and over not to work](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/gender-equality/focusing-on-what-works-for-workplace-diversity), **you could make a much bigger dent by relocating that budget toward interview practice for your candidates**.\n\nThere is a lot of loud conversation in Silicon Valley about fixing representation in tech. **It\u2019s time to stop talking and instead do something that actually moves the needle. If interviewing.io had the means to give five mock interviews to every student in the US who doesn\u2019t have the ability to pay for them, we\u2019d do it right now.**\n\nMy years of experience have shown me that there are countless members of underrepresented groups who are ready and able to be outstanding engineers, but who have been unable to pass their technical interview. We at interviewing.io are determined to make a difference, and we want to give people the same gift that MIT once gave me: the knowledge that interview practice is everything and that failing an interview doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not cut out for this career.\n\nIf you want to help us, [get in touch](mailto:hello@interviewing.io).\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

Our new take on Binary Search teaches one template that works for every binary search problem on LeetCode, with only a single-line change you need to remember. The Sliding Windows chapter features 6 unique sliding window templates that make off-by-one errors a thing of the past.\n\n**EDIT:** [*Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/195570600X) is out now! Here's the table of contents:\n\n![Beyond CtCI table of contents](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cover_toc_b77bec4593.png)\n\nI have some exciting news. Along with Gayle Laakmann McDowell, Mike Mroczka, and Nil Mamano, I\u2019m writing the official sequel to *Cracking the Coding Interview* (often called the bible of technical interview prep). It's fittingly called [*Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview.*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/195570600X)\n\nI\u2019ve always wanted to write a book about technical interviewing. And this is it. And of course it'll draw on all the hiring data we've collected over the past decade at interviewing.io.\n\nTechnical interviews are much harder today than they used to be. Engineers study for months and routinely get down-leveled despite that. [*Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/195570600X), in addition to covering a bunch of new questions and topics, teaches you how to think instead of memorizing. Grinding and memorization isn\u2019t the way in this market (though in fairness, it\u2019s never really the way). With us, you\u2019ll still have to do the work, of course, but we\u2019ll teach you to work smarter.\n\n[![Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview book cover](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/book_cover_87f67665fd.png)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/195570600X)\n\nWe added at least thirteen new technical topics (I say \u201cat least\u201d because we\u2019re still writing, and it might be more like twenty)\u2014and over 150 new problems. Each problem includes step-by-step walkthroughs, and you can work each problem with our (actually good) AI Interviewer. And of course this book was written in partnership with interviewing.io. We\u2019ve pulled in data from over 100k FAANG mock interviews on interviewing.io, and we include hundreds of curated interview replays from interviewing.io (shared with permission of course) \u2013 watch people make mistakes and learn so you\u2019re not doomed to repeat them.\n\nBut it\u2019s not *just* about interview prep. In today\u2019s job market, the bar is higher but it\u2019s also harder than ever to get noticed and run your job search end-to-end. My excellent co-authors killed it on the technical chapters. I focused on writing the job search stuff, including, but not limited to:\n\n- How to negotiate, exactly what to say, and how to not screw up your negotiations before they even start\n- How to manage your job search, end to end, and balance interview prep with applications and outreach\n- A worksheet to help you figure out what order you need to engage with the companies you\u2019re targeting to ensure that all your offers come in at the same time\n- How to get in the door at top companies without relying on referrals, including email templates and examples of good and bad outreach\n- An internal look at FAANG (and other) company rubrics to help understand what interviewers really care about, no matter what company you're applying to\n- What you need to know about behavioral interviews, whether you want to or not, and how to avoid the mistakes that even great engineers make\n- A list of very specific questions to ask your interviewers (not just to look smart but to learn useful things)\n- How technical interviews got to be so broken and how to get over hating them so you can win\n\nI also spend some time on owning and sharing data on how flawed technical interviewing is and, most importantly, how to manage your psychology so you can get past that. I see so many engineers opting out of this interview style, arguably for good reason. But you\u2019re leaving a lot of good opportunities on the table, and it doesn\u2019t have to be like that.\n\nThis book is so much of what I\u2019ve blogged about for the last 15 years, but it\u2019s fleshed out with much more detail and actionable advice. If you read it, let me know what you think. Technical interviewing sucks (and so does looking for a job). But this book will help you do it well and get out alive.\n\n**Purchases of [*Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/195570600X) get a $50 discount for interviewing.io. The book costs $45, so it\u2019s not a bad deal. The book is out in January of 2025, and you can [get it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/195570600X).**\n\nLife is chaos and pain.

Presumably, these certifications would signal to recruiters that this person is a good engineer and worth reaching out to and should carry more signal than where said person went to school or worked previously.\n\nI think certifications are a terrible idea, and I\u2019ve resisted building them. Simply put, the incentives they create for engineers and recruiters are all wrong. To explain what I mean, let\u2019s split engineers into two distinct personas:\n\n- **The engineer who looks good on paper. This person will simply not list the certification on their profile \u2013 they have no reason to!** They\u2019re already getting contacted by at least 10 recruiters a day. Chances are, they\u2019re actively ignoring LinkedIn unless they\u2019ve decided that they\u2019re looking and want to respond to a handful of the hundreds of InMails they\u2019ve gotten already to give themselves more optionality during their job search.\n- **The engineer who doesn\u2019t look good on paper. This person will likely add a certification to their profile. It\u2019s rational \u2013 anything that helps them stand out and legitimize their profile, in the absence of traditional pedigree, is a win. That sounds great, right? Unfortunately, here\u2019s the rub. Unless your certification is respected by recruiters and well-established, they will not take it seriously\u2026 because it runs counter to everything they\u2019ve been tuned to look for**. If your profile doesn\u2019t have a reputable school or a top company on it, then an unknown certification won\u2019t save you, and over time, listing it will do harm. Because the certification will almost always go hand in hand with lack of pedigree (as you saw above, people who look good on paper will have no reason to list it on their profiles), recruiters will start to develop negative associations with it. Because most recruiters will not engage with these candidates for long enough to find out if they\u2019re good or not, this will happen even if the certification actually carries a positive signal. In other words, recruiters will learn, over time, to associate the presence of the certification with a \u201cno-go\u201d because it will only be on profiles that have previously been trained not to reach out to.\n\nThat\u2019s the theory of why certifications are bad. They\u2019re bad for the individuals listing them, and they\u2019re bad for the industry as a whole because, ironically, they make it harder to find good candidates. But what happens when you look at the data?\n\n## The setup\n\nEngineers use interviewing.io for anonymous mock interviews. If things go well, they skip right to the technical interview at real companies (which is also fully anonymous). We started interviewing.io because resumes suck and because we believe that anyone, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to prove their mettle.\n\nAt this point, we\u2019ve hosted over 100k technical interviews, split between mocks and real ones.\n\nRegardless of the interview type, when an interviewer and an interviewee match on our platform, they join a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard, and jump right into a technical interview. After each interview, both parties leave feedback, and once they\u2019ve both submitted, each one can see what the other person said and how they were rated.\n\nHere\u2019s what the feedback form that interviewers fill out looks like:\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/unnamed_1_d9f00a2248.png)\n**In this post, we aggregated scores from these interviews for each interviewee and then cross-referenced how many certifications they listed on their LinkedIn profiles.**\n\nYou might say that an engineer\u2019s performance in interviews on our platform isn\u2019t the canonical source of truth for their engineering ability, and you\u2019d certainly be right. In the absence of holistic performance review data about our users, which is pretty much impossible to get, we decided running this study was still worthwhile. For what it\u2019s worth, I have pretty high conviction that performance in interviews on our platform correlates very strongly with performance in interviews in the real world \u2013 our candidates tend to pass real interviews 3X better than candidates from other sources. Fully closing that loop with on-the-job performance data is the holy grail of any recruiting enterprise, and I hope we can do it one day.\n\n## The hypothesis\n\nCaveats aside, before doing the analysis, our hypothesis was that having one or more certifications on your profile would have a strong negative correlation with your interview performance. Why?\n\n1. We\u2019ve seen in the past that though [having attended a top school doesn\u2019t correlate with interview performance](https://interviewing.io/blog/we-looked-at-how-a-thousand-college-students-performed-in-technical-interviews-to-see-if-where-they-went-to-school-mattered-it-didnt), having worked at a top employer does. We saw above that people who look good on paper aren\u2019t going to be incentivized to put certifications on their profile, which means that we\u2019ve just cut a lot of top performers from the pool.\n2. This leaves people who don\u2019t look good on paper. Because top performers aren\u2019t evenly distributed between pedigreed and unpedigreed candidates, there will be fewer top performers in this pool. But even if they were, by definition, only a small part of this population will be top performers. Therefore, most of the people in this pool will not be top performers, which means that most of the people who are incentivized to list certifications on their profile will not be top performers.\n\n**Basically, people who look good on paper are disincentivized to list certifications. People who don\u2019t look good on paper are incentivized to list them, but most of them are not top performers. Therefore, most of the people listing certifications are not top performers.**\n\nIf we\u2019re right, not only is creating certifications not useful, but doing so will also have the unfortunate side effect of making recruiters dig in their heels about the importance of pedigree, will, over time, reduce the marginal utility of any new certifications and will ultimately harm attempts at making technical recruiting more fair or meritocratic.\n\n## What the data actually says\n\nIn this analysis, we took a list of our users for whom we had interview data and, where possible, analyzed their LinkedIn profiles. **We ended up analyzing about 20K LinkedIn profiles, 28% of which had some kind of certification. We then pulled out the top 10 most frequent certification authorities, so we could break them out and do some more granular analysis.** These were (in order of frequency, i.e. Coursera had the most hits):\n\n- Coursera\n- LinkedIn\n- Triplebyte\n- Microsoft\n- Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n- Oracle\n- Udacity\n- Udemy\n- HackerRank\n- Cisco\n\nBecause people usually do multiple interviews on our platform, we ended up with about 40k observations (i.e., interviews) in each regression.\n\nOur first result is that people with certifications do worse in interviews, as shown in the bar chart below. **People with certifications on their LinkedIn profiles pass interviews on our platform about 53% of the time versus 57% of the time for people without certifications, a very statistically significant difference (p < 0.00001).** Remember that these interviews are completely anonymous. The interviewer isn\u2019t basing their ratings on the person\u2019s LinkedIn\u2014just their interview performance.\n\nWant to make sure your interview performance is in tip-top shape, regardless of your LinkedIn? Sign up for anonymous mock interviews with engineers from top companies.\n\n[See available times](https://interviewing.io/signup)\n\n![](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcta.47351a0d.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/certification_effect_eb27700235.png)\n\n**Notably, the certification \u201cpenalty\u201d is equally large whether people had the certifications up in 2021 or 2023. So there\u2019s no sign that today\u2019s depressed labor market changed the nature of the signal.**\n\nHow much of this difference is due to the fact that people with certifications do different kinds of interviews? We next adjusted for the language (e.g., Python, Java) and focus (e.g., frontend, machine learning) of the interview and only compare Java coders to Java coders, Python to Python, etc. This control ensures that the results are not driven by broad patterns at the group level, asking whether certifications are predictive of performance compared only to candidates coding in the same language. If anything, the \u201cInterview language & focus controls\u201d bar shows that this makes certifications look slightly worse. When you compare certified people to non-certified people within the narrow types of interviews they typically choose, they lag just a bit further behind.\n\nNext, we wanted to know how much of this difference is explainable by the attributes of the person. For example, people who seek out certifications may have a non-quantitative background. Perhaps they majored in communications rather than computer science. Or they are a paralegal trying to switch career paths. **Indeed, we observe this pattern in the data: people with non-traditional backgrounds are about 30% more likely to have a certification.**\n\nTo account for this selection, we just compared people with similar backgrounds. For instance, does a Harvard graduate with a certification do better or worse than a Harvard graduate without one? This correction shrinks the gap by about 40 percent (see the \u201cPedigree controls\u201d bar).\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/certification_effect_controls_592ab3c690.png)\n\nNote: All differences between the certified and uncertified users are statistically significant (p < .01 or smaller).\n\n**So, LinkedIn certifications are indeed a negative tag for candidates on our platform. This isn\u2019t explained by the kinds of interviews they do. But we can show that part of it is due to the fact that certified people tend to have non-traditional backgrounds. The remainder of the gap is probably due to similar dynamics: you get certified if you have something to prove.**\n\n### Not all certifications are created equal\n\nThis analysis treats certifications as binary. Either you have it or you don\u2019t. But there are a range of authorities out there that give certifications: are any of them a positive tag?\n\nWe did similar regression analysis for the top ten certifiers in the data. The results are below:\n\n![](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/certification_effect_by_company_47d9163301.png)\n\nThe one standout is Triplebyte. Their graduates are 6 percentage points more likely to pass interviews \u2014a serious boost, albeit not enough to dispel the negative signal that all the others carry. The worst is the Cisco badge, with a 10 percentage point drop in performance.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhen we dug into the data, we saw that people from non-traditional backgrounds do indeed list certifications on their LinkedIn profile more often than their well-pedigreed counterparts. People whose most recent schooling is a web development certificate or associate's degree score are about 30% more likely to display a certification.\n\nWe also saw that, generally speaking, certifications carry a negative signal and that these results hold up even in the increasingly employer-favorable 2023 job market (in other words, good candidates haven\u2019t suddenly started listing certifications on their profiles to get noticed).\n\nAs we expected, these realities create an unfortunate feedback loop. Recruiters tend to value pedigree above all else, which means they\u2019re less likely to talk to non-traditional candidates. When they see non-traditional candidate profiles with certifications, because they weren\u2019t going to talk to them anyway, over time they\u2019ll develop a negative association with those certifications.\n\nFurthermore, given that people who list certifications are more likely to perform worse in interviews, when they choose pedigreed candidates who have a certification and those candidates perform worse, that negative association will be strengthened.\n\nBecause of these mechanics, certifications get reinforced as bad in recruiters\u2019 minds, and listing them on your profile ends up being a counterproductive strategy for diamonds in the rough, the very candidates whom certifications were supposed to help in the first place.\n\nLife is chaos and pain. Interview prep doesn't have to be.\n\n![Video Preview](/static/images/cyber-corgi/artboard.svg)\n\nGet instant access to anonymous mock interviews, salary negotiation, and the world's largest library of interview replays.\n\n[Get started](/signup)\n\n#### Related posts\n\n[We looked at how a thousand college students performed in technical interviews to see if where they went to school mattered.

We\u2019re trying something new. Up till now, all posts on this blog have been written by interviewing.io employees or contractors. Why? Frankly, it\u2019s hard to find great content in the recruiting space. There\u2019s so much fluff and bad advice out there, and we didn\u2019t want any part of that.*\n\n*The other day though, I was reading Hacker News and saw* [*an article by Uduak Obong-Eren about how he did over 60 technical interviews in 30 days*](https://medium.com/@meekg33k/14-lessons-i-learned-from-doing-60-technical-interviews-in-30-days-7732e4f7608d?source=---------4------------------) *and what he learned from that gauntlet of an experience. I thought it was honest, vulnerable, well-written, and brimming with actionable advice. So, I reached out to him to see if he\u2019d want to write something else. Fortunately, he did, and the article below is the inaugural post in what I hope will become our Guest Author series. You can read more about Uduak in the bio below.*\n\n*A quick note because this is the first time we\u2019re doing this. One of the things I\u2019m most excited about with this new Guest Author series is the diversity of opinions it will bring to our blog. Technical interviewing and hiring is fraught with controversy, and not everything these posts contain will be in line with my opinions or the official opinions of interviewing.io. But that\u2019s what\u2019s great about it. After over a decade in this business, I \\*still\\* don\u2019t think there\u2019s a right way to conduct interviews, and I think hiring is always going to be a bit of a mess because it\u2019s a fundamentally human process. Even if we don\u2019t always agree, I do promise that the content we put forth will be curated, high quality, and written by smart people who are passionate about this space.*\n\n*Now, off we go!*\n\n![Author avatar](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FUduak_Obong_Eren_0a6ec8d658.jpg&w=384&q=75 \"Uduak Obong-Eren\")\n\nUduak Obong-Eren\n\nUduak Obong-Eren is a Software Engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area who is passionate about architecting and building scalable software systems. He has about five years of industry experience and holds a Masters in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University. He is also an open source enthusiast and writes technical articles \u2013 you can view some of his writings at [https://meekg33k.dev](https://meekg33k.dev/). He especially enjoys conducting free mock technical interviews to help folks get better at technical interviewing. You can follow him on Twitter [@meekg33k](https://twitter.com/meekg33k).\n\nWhat is the one thing you would look out for if you had to join a company?\n\nSometime between January and February 2020, I wanted to change jobs and was looking to join a new company. This, among other reasons, led me to embark on a marathon of technical interviews \u2013 [60+ technical interviews in 30 days](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-i-learned-from-doing-60-technical-interviews-in-30-days/).\n\nDoing that many number of interviews in such a short time meant I had an interesting mix of experiences from the various companies I interviewed with, each with their unique culture and values that often reflected in the way their interviews were conducted, intentionally or not.\n\nIn this article, I will be sharing some of the red flags I observed while I was on this marathon of technical interviews. I will not be mentioning names of any companies because that\u2019s not the intent behind this article.\n\nThe goal of this article is also not to make you paranoid and be on the hunt for red flags in your next interview, far from it. Rather the goal is to equip you with knowledge to help you immediately identify exactly the same or similar red flags in your next interview\\*,\\* and hopefully identifying them will set you up to better handle them.\n\nEven though the stories I\u2019ll be sharing come from my marathon of *technical* interviews, these red flags do not apply only to technical interviews. They apply to all kinds of interviews and so there\u2019s a lot to learn here for everyone.\n\n## The Red Flags\n\n### Your interviewer is only open to solving the problem ONE way\n\nIn the world of computing and in life generally, for any given problem, there is typically more than one way to solve that problem. For example, given a sorting problem, you could solve it using a [merge-sort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/merge-sort) algorithm or a [heap sort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/heap-sort) algorithm.\n\nHaving this rich number of techniques to solve a problem makes it even more interesting and the general expectation in technical interviews is that you should have the flexibility to solve a problem using your preferred technique.\n\nI had an interview where the interviewer asked me to solve an algorithmic problem. I had started solving the problem using a specific technique when the interviewer stopped me in my tracks and asked that I use another technique.\n\nWhen I probed a bit further to know why, it appeared that the reason he asked that I used the second wasn\u2019t to test my knowledge of that second technique; it was because he was more \u2018comfortable\u2019 with that approach.\n\nIt is different if the interviewer wants to test your knowledge of something very specific. For example, given a problem that can be solved using iteration and [recursion](https://interviewing.io/recursion-interview-questions), the interviewer may want to test your knowledge of recursion and can ask you to solve the problem recursively. That wasn\u2019t the case here.\n\nI ended up using both techniques and discussed the trade-offs but frankly that experience left a bad taste in my mouth especially because that interview was with the hiring manager \u2014 my would-be manager, who is someone that can significantly influence your career growth and trajectory.\n\n### Undue pressure to accept an offer letter\n\nIt\u2019s very exciting and fulfilling when you go through all preliminary stages of a technical interview, through to the onsite interview (remote or in-person) and then you receive that \u201c*Congratulations <insert name here>, we are pleased to offer you\u2026*\u201d email.\n\nHowever, that excitement often becomes short-lived when there is some form of pressure from your soon-to-be employer to accept the offer. It\u2019s a bit more manageable when the pressure comes from someone in HR or the recruiter, but when it\u2019s from the hiring manager, that can be harder to manage.\n\nThat was the case for me when I interviewed with a startup based in Palo Alto. They were a small company in terms of staff strength. My onsite interview with them had gone quite well. I had a good conversation with the hiring manager and an even better conversation with the VP of Engineering, so much so that I could tell that I was going to be extended an offer. I asked to know how long I had to accept the offer letter and I was told seventy-two hours.\n\nThe offer letter arrived later that evening, and it looked great \u2014 a six-figure offer definitely didn\u2019t seem like a bad start. I was also at the final stage of the interview process with other companies too and thankfully, I had enough time to negotiate and accept the offer, or so I thought.\n\nThen the pressure started, incessant calls from the hiring manager and the VP of Engineering, back-to-back emails, all within the allotted time. So much was the pressure that it got to a point where I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to negotiate the offer anymore. I turned down the offer.\n\nI turned down the offer because the experience got me thinking about the company\u2019s work culture. Were the methods employed by the company to get me to accept the offer indicative of their work culture? If they needed to get something done, how far would they go?\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, yes the company wants to employ you, yes the recruiting team wants to \u2018close the deal\u2019 however, it\u2019s very important to pay attention to how the company does this. Do they remain professional about it?\n\nA company\u2019s values go beyond what they say, it shows in what they do and how they do it.\n\n### Not enough clarity about your role\n\nAmong the many reasons why you would join a company is your desire to be involved in valuable work. I had the opportunity to join a US company based in Boulder, Colorado. They had contracted a recruiting agency to help them find someone to fill a Software Engineer position in their firm.\n\nThe hiring process started with an exploratory interview with the recruiting agency closely followed by a second interview with a recruiter from the company. In both interviews, I couldn\u2019t get a clear sense of the details of my specific role was \u2014 what team I would be on, what kinds of projects I\u2019d be working on, what the career growth pathway was, etc.\n\nI understand that sometimes companies can be going through restructuring, but that didn\u2019t seem to be the case here. It seemed more like the company was focused on completing their headcount. Even though there\u2019s nothing wrong with completing a headcount, I think there is everything wrong with not having a clear purpose for a role for a couple of reasons:\n\n- It means the role may not be critical to the company\u2019s core business.\n- If the role isn\u2019t that important, it may mean when a layoff comes, your position may be impacted.\n\nOn a more personal note, I don\u2019t want to be just a number. I want to work at a place where I have the opportunity to contribute in an impactful way, and I like to believe you would too. So it\u2019s important to get clarity about your role, for where you are today and for future career growth.\n\n### Consistent lack of interest or low morale from interviewers\n\nWhen looking to join a company, one of the things you simply must care about is the team you will end up working on. At least 25% of your waking hours will be spent interacting with that team whether in-person or virtually.\n\nInterviews offer you an opportunity to experience firsthand what it will look like to work with your prospective teammates, especially since, unless you\u2019re interviewing at a huge company, your interviewers are likely to become your teammates.\n\nIf through all the different stages of the interview process, you experience a **consistent** lack of interest or low morale from your interviewers, you might want to pay attention .\n\nWhen I experienced that during one of my interviews, I couldn\u2019t exactly tell what the cause was, but I knew something just wasn\u2019t right. After some internal tussle, I decided to trust my gut feelings and ended the interview process with the company.\n\nFast forward to two months after, two of my interviewers (would-be teammates) had left the company and joined another company (no I wasn\u2019t stalking, I just checked on LinkedIn).\n\nNow I\u2019m not saying that during the interview process, there won\u2019t be one or two people, who because of their busy schedules, would have preferred to be doing something else rather than interviewing. Yet, when all of the interviewers don\u2019t want to be there, you certainly want to pay attention to that.\n\nA lack of interest or low morale could be pointers to a combination of any of the following:\n\n- Your prospective team-mates may be experiencing burnout.\n- Some internal dissatisfaction with company \u2014 culture, policies, something, anything.\n- The team isn\u2019t that interested in you (hard pill to swallow?), maybe they don\u2019t see you as a long-term hire.\n\nOr it could be for reasons that I have not included here, but I implore you to not ignore this red flag if you see it in your next interview.\n\n### Your interviewers aren\u2019t prepared for the interview\n\nHave you been in an interview before where the interviewer doesn\u2019t seem to have any questions to ask you? Trust me it can get really awkward.\n\nThat was my experience during a technical phone-screen interview with an educational technology company based in California. The interviewer wasn\u2019t prepared for our interview and didn\u2019t have any questions at hand. He wasn\u2019t even sure of who he was interviewing and what role I was interviewing for. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant experience.\n\nI understand that there are a myriad of reasons why interviewers may not be prepared for an interview. Some of which include:\n\n- Lack of proper planning by the HR/recruiting team.\n- Last-minute changes on the interviewee.\n- Busy schedules for the interviewer.\n- The interviewer just wasn\u2019t prepared.\n\nI typically won\u2019t act on this red flag in isolation. I will be looking for other red flags in a bid to form a cluster of patterns before making any decision.\n\n### Lack of a clear direction on where the company is headed\n\nIt\u2019s fulfilling to be a part of a company that is involved in meaningful work that creates value for its users. Joining such a company would mean you have the desire to contribute in helping the organization meet its goals. This invariably means the organization must have some goals right?\n\nI was contacted by a startup based in San Francisco via [AngelList](https://wellfound.com/). I had a first introductory call with a recruiter from the company, closely followed by a phone screen technical interview.\n\nIn both interviews, even though the interviewers shared some details about the company, there was a lot of vagueness and about the company\u2019s direction and where the company was headed.\n\nI particularly remember that one question I asked at the time, was about how the company would deal with its growing competition. Sadly, the answers I got didn\u2019t seem convincing and the company later got acquired by the competition.\n\nWhen you are interviewing to join a company, you are selling more than just your skills, but also yourself \u2014 your unique experience. While it\u2019s important to do that, I think it\u2019s equally important that the company should be able to sell you on its vision and what it hopes to achieve.\n\nWhen I think of joining a company, I picture myself in that company for the next 2\u20135 years. If my vision for where I want to be in my career doesn\u2019t align with the company\u2019s vision, that is a mismatch that shouldn\u2019t be ignored.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe sometimes focus more on securing the job and even though that is very important, even more important than getting the job is staying fulfilled on the job. **For me, fulfillment meant joining a company that had a clear vision of where they were headed, working in a role that was critical to the company\u2019s business while being equipped with a lot of growth opportunities**.\n\nHopefully, these red flags I have shared will equip you to make better decisions on what companies you choose to grow your career with. I would generally not advise making a decision based on one or two red flags, but if you see a cluster of red flags, you shouldn\u2019t ignore them. I wish you the best in your career journey.\n\nIf you ever need someone to do a mock interview with you, feel free to schedule one [here](https://interviewing.io/) or you can reach out directly to me on Twitter [@meekg33k](https://twitter.com/meekg33k).\n\nAnd if you\u2019d like a list of things to ask companies while you\u2019re interviewing that may help you identify these red flags (and others!) sooner, [take a look at this one](https://blog.alinelerner.com/how-to-interview-your-interviewers/).\n\n---\n\n*If you have something to say about your adventures in interviewing or hiring, write a guest post on our blog!

I know it seems like we are talking about interviewing all the time, but we are usually talking about only one half of the equation: How to be a good candidate. What about the other half? What about the interviewer?\n\nIn the last decade, there has been an explosion of attention for candidates and how to improve their interview performance. This stands in stark contrast to the preparation of the *interviewer*. If you are lucky, your interviewer might have gotten a two hour class on how to ask only bona fide work related questions and has sat through two shadow interviews. Maybe they have even done a few interviews! Consequently, there is a lot of bad interviewing being done.

Also, fewer people were actually getting offers; the onsite pass rate had fallen by almost a third, from ~40% to under 30%. This meant we needed even more interviews for every hire. Visnu and I were early engineers bothered most by the state of our hiring process. We dug in. Within a few months, the onsite pass rate went back up, and interviewing burnout receded.

Time to hire is important because it lets you plan \u2014 if a given role has historically taken 3 months to fill, you\u2019re going to act differently when you need to fill it again than if it takes 2 weeks.
