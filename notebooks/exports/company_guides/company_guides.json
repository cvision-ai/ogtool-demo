Google\u2019s interview process and questions\n\n## Google\u2019s interview process and questions\n\nGoogle\u2019s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n- Recruiter call\n- Technical phone screen (and possibly a second technical phone screen)\n- Onsite\n- Team matching\n\n![Google\u2019s interview process: recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite, team matching](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fgoogle-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Google\u2019s job interview process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nAll human organizations behave like a metaphor; Google isn\u2019t a sports team, or a family, or an army. It\u2019s a cool grad school. Larry and Sergey set up their offices based on the model of a Stanford campus on purpose. They wanted to create an environment and company culture where people can feel chill enough to talk about anything. In general, Google interviewers tend to be more collaborative than other FAANG interviewers. At Google, the slower you go, the faster you get there.\n\nGoogle has one big, centralized interview process that\u2019s completely divorced from which team you might end up on, which means that you will NOT, however, be interviewing with your future team members \u2013 Google has a horde of interchangeable technical interviewers who have all been trained on the same process. If you do well, there will be a team matching component at the end.\n\nAt Google, because the process is centralized, you cannot interview with multiple teams concurrently, which means you don\u2019t get multiple shots on goal. Not only that, but Google has a limit for how many chances they\u2019ll give you before you\u2019re blocked from interviewing again.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n\u201cYou can interview three times in 5 years. If you fail all three times then you can\u2019t interview at Google again: you\u2019re blocked.\u201d\n\nNote that recently, there have been rumblings of Google changing their process to something more decentralized, where a hiring manager chooses you for a team *before* you interview, nullifying the need for post-onsite team matching. As far as we know, this new model is being tried out right now, but the change hasn\u2019t been adopted company-wide.\n\nGoogle also has rules for candidates who *pass* their interviews:\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n\u201cIf you pass Google\u2019s onsite, and end up not taking the offer, your \u201cpassing of the onsite '' is good for about a year. And if you choose to re-engage in that time, the process varies widely. Usually you can skip the phone interview. Most times you have to do the full or partial onsite. If you choose to re-engage, tell their recruiters \u2018I already passed the onsite\u2019 and push to get as many steps skipped as you can.\u201d\n\nGoogle is not results-oriented. They\u2019re process oriented. In other words, they care more about the \u201cHow\u201d than the \u201cWhat\u201d. You\u2019ve heard it before, and it\u2019s true \u2013 they don\u2019t need you to get to the optimal solution, but they do need to be impressed by your thought process. Because of this, Google is more attracted to comfort with ambiguity than speed.\n\nOddly, in spite of using a centralized interview process, Google doesn\u2019t have in-depth training for its interviewers; it may surprise some candidates that there\u2019s a larger-than-expected number of bad interviewers at Google.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n\u201cThere is one thing that always bothered me about the Google interview process. And it's something that a lot of candidates don\u2019t realize. There are a lot of bad interviewers at Google. Mostly because there are a lot of highly talented people who think they know everything.\n\nI was the interviewer for the third interview round at in-person onsite. And I saw the candidate was there by himself; the second interviewer wasn\u2019t there. The candidate was alone because the second interviewer got frustrated \u2013 they thought the candidate wasn\u2019t worth the time for an onsite, so they left early.\u201d\n\n#### Anecdote from an Interviewer Who Worked at Google and Facebook\n\n\u201cGoogle is more likely than Facebook to design questions on purpose to be tricky. At Google, sometimes this is intentionally disguising technical questions to look like X but they\u2019re really Y. And other times at Google, it\u2019s designing a technical question such that if a candidate doesn\u2019t ask a particular question they likely won\u2019t get the answer.\u201d\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [\u201cA note about recruiter calls\u201d](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone screen\n\nGoogle\u2019s technical phone screen is a coding interview that focuses exclusively on data structures and algorithms questions. Your interviewer will ask you to write code to solve a specific problem.\n\nOne idiosyncratic aspect of Google\u2019s process is their insistence on using Google docs for writing code (versus other companies which tend to use tools like CoderPad). This can be a bit jarring for those of us who are used to writing code in an IDE that does things like auto-indentation, auto-complete, syntax highlighting, adding missing parentheses or brackets etc. Despite not using an IDE, your interviewer will expect you to produce syntactically correct code. This is really hard.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nBefore your Google interview, you should practice in Google docs so you don\u2019t forget to close parentheses or indent your code.\n\nThat said, more recently, Google has started interviewing using an internal tool with syntax highlighting, indentation and brackets completion. Whether you get to use it or not depends on your geography.\n\n### Step 2.5: (In some cases) Another technical phone screen\n\nThe second phone screen happens only if the first one did not produce enough signal to move forward. Perhaps you didn\u2019t communicate your thought process well enough, your code wasn\u2019t of good enough quality, or you weren\u2019t fast enough \u2013 but it\u2019ll be only one of these \u2013 if you struggled with two or all three, most likely you aren\u2019t moving forward.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you do get scheduled for a second phone screen, push your recruiter to give you detailed feedback so you can do better the second time \u2013 nothing beats knowing *exactly* where you need to improve. You probably won\u2019t get a response, but if you do it\u2019s a large boost to your prep.\n\nIf you get a second phone screen it will be very similar to the first in terms of structure and content.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe Google onsite usually includes 4-6 rounds. Recently, there have been some internal experiments with the format, but generally the rounds are primarily coding, and secondarily system design. Some candidates get a single behavioral round, and others get to skip it.\n\nThe more experience you have, the higher proportion of system design and domain-specific questions you can expect to be asked.\n\n## Google\u2019s interview types in detail\n\nAs we mentioned above, Google is process-oriented rather than results-oriented. As such, communication during coding and system design rounds is more important at Google than the end result.\n\n### Coding\n\n**The most important rounds at Google are coding. In fact, Google is the only FAANG company that considers coding to be more important than system design**. Google\u2019s coding rounds are about complexity more than speed. Their interviewers are allowed to ask anything they want, so it's more likely you might get a question you\u2019ve never practiced before.\n\nGoogle interviewers are more likely than any other FAANG company to purposefully design a question so it tricks candidates. For example, they\u2019ll disguise a question to look like it\u2019s Three Sum, but that\u2019s a red herring \u2013 it\u2019s not a Three Sum problem. It just looks like one.\n\nA lot of what you\u2019ll see in the onsite coding mirrors what you saw in the technical phone screen. During the onsite, you may see your interviewer layer more complexity on top of questions \u2013 they\u2019ll design a question where they plan for you to get to the solution, then when you do they\u2019ll move the goalposts and say something like: \u201cRemember that assumption we made earlier about [X thing]? Let\u2019s remove that. How would that change your approach?\u201d\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n\u201cAt Google, I\u2019ve passed more people that *arrive at the optimal solution without coding it* than I do people who *arrive at the optimal solution and code it*. The actual code you write is less important than the thought process.\u201d\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n\u201cGoogle is highly unstructured. Everyone can ask whatever they want.\u201d\n\nEven though they can ask whatever they want, Google interviewers have a question bank too, but the bank is much much bigger than Facebook\u2019s bank and, like Facebook\u2019s bank, it\u2019s community maintained. Some interviewers never deviate from the bank, and others don\u2019t touch it, preferring instead to formulate their own unique questions..\n\nThis speaks to Google rewarding the \u201chow\u201d (aka \u201chow a candidate got there\u201d) or their thought processes. It also speaks to Google rewarding comfort with ambiguity. Other FAANGs have specific niche topics they love hearing and talking about (such as \u201cperformance\u201d at Amazon), but Google is more abstract. Google might love speaking about and asking about ambiguity more than any other FAANG.\n\nFinally, Google\u2019s coding questions are never practical. They are always theoretical. They will never ask you to pull up your own environment and write a program. They will also never ask you to take a solution to a coding problem and apply it to a real world scenario. When prepping for Google, only practice theoretical questions.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Google\u2019s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Google coding interview preparation resources](#google-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design\n\nThe second most important onsite interview type at Google is system design. Again, they are allowed to ask anything they want, so don\u2019t be scared off if you get a question you\u2019ve never practiced before.\n\nHigh-level and low-level system design questions are both likely. Some examples include:\n\n- Design a load balancer\n- Design Facebook Messenger\n- Design an auth platform\n\nGoogle system design interviewers also tend to design problems that include linchpin questions. These are questions where if you don\u2019t ask about a specific aspect of the problem, you can\u2019t really solve it. For example, an older system design question at Google asked you to set up a service in some foreign country, and in the prompt, the interviewer mentioned that you have a dependency on some third party service.\n\nThe linchpin question to ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s the service level agreement for that 3rd party service?\u201d If you didn\u2019t ask that (or something like it), then you wouldn\u2019t be able to effectively reason about availability, which you\u2019d need to do in order to do well on the question.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nTo avoid getting tricked, ask even more questions in Google system design rounds than you normally would.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThe least important round at Google is the behavioral round. They have the easiest behavioral screen in FAANG. Plus, you might complete an onsite at Google without a behavioral round because they\u2019re optional. It\u2019s not clear which candidates get them and which don\u2019t. This is another reason to not prep too hard for their behavioral round.\n\nIf you do get some behavioral questions, they might be one of the following:\n\n- Tell me about a time when you had a colleague who was difficult to work with.\n- Tell me about a time you received negative feedback.\n- Tell me about a time you were mentoring a more junior engineer and your feedback wasn\u2019t getting through to them.\n- If you were going to plan an offsite for the team, how would you do it?\n\nGoogle is also more likely to ask you reflective questions. Most other FAANGs stick to situational questions such as, \u201cTell me of a time when\u2026\u201d. Those situational questions ask you to describe a past circumstance or scenario you\u2019ve actually experienced and are fairly straightforward to answer. Reflective questions, on the other hand, can be tricky because they\u2019re asking you to reflect on, or speak to, something less concrete, e.g., \u201cWhat do you think about setting goals?\u201d\n\nThe smart way to answer a reflective question is to re-formulate it, and then answer as if it\u2019s a situational question. So, \u201cWhat do you think about setting goals\u201d instead becomes,\u201dTalk about a time you used goal-setting as a time management strategy\u201d, which you can now more-easily answer by describing a real experience and outcome, \u201cThe last time I set goals\u2026etc\u201d, as opposed to wading into theories about personal agency. \u201cI think goals are cool and important\u2026\u201d might not get high marks.\n\n### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n\u201cTo be honest, there was some cultural backlash at Google when they announced that we had to do these behavioral interviews. What that means is you may get an interviewer who has very little interest in conducting this type of interview. Which could go very good or very bad. I have some peers who think this should not be a part of the interview process. So they give everyone the highest marks, pretty much just to eliminate this category from the interview. Google is primarily engineers, and most of the engineers think that this is a bunch of HR BS. So they either just won\u2019t accept any calendar invites they get or they'll just check the boxes.\u201d\n\n## How Google makes hiring decisions\n\nMost of the time, the post-interview feedback process at Google is completely asynchronous, and interviewers don\u2019t meet live to discuss hiring decisions. That\u2019s one reason why interviewing at Google isn\u2019t like interviewing with humans: it\u2019s more akin to interviewing with a machine.\n\nEach interviewer rates candidates on the following seven-point scale: Strong No-Hire, No Hire, Leaning No-Hire, On The Fence, Leaning Hire, Hire, and Strong Hire.\n\nHow this affects candidates is simple: a Strong Hire can get you an offer, but it can also buy you a second chance. If you don\u2019t get an offer, but you get a Strong Hire from one of your interviewers, you might be offered one bonus interview round to decide whether you get an offer or not.\n\nThat said, you don\u2019t need to get a \u201cStrong Hire\u201d to get a second chance. Overall, if you showed enough signal to not-fail but not enough to pass, sometimes they will ask you to do an additional round.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you get lucky enough to get a round where you are really excelling, don\u2019t quit while you\u2019re ahead. Keep going. In that round, don\u2019t just strive to win; strive for total domination.\n\nA \u201cStrong No-Hire\u201d bars you from interviewing at Google for some time. Reports vary here, but one of our Google interviewers told us that if you get a Strong No-Hire, you might be frozen out for several years.\n\nIf you passed overall then you will move on to the hiring committee phase.\n\n### Hiring committee review & team matching\n\nGoogle\u2019s hiring committee consists of four to five engineers and engineering managers who have not interviewed you, with the intent of making hiring decisions as objective as possible.\n\nGoing into the hiring committee review, your recruiter will prepare a packet that consists of your resume, any notes from the person who referred you (if you were referred), your recruiter\u2019s notes from their call with you, and all the feedback from your interviewers, from the technical phone screen to the onsite.\n\n#### Resume screening tip\n\nIf you\u2019re told you\u2019ve passed the onsite, ask if you can submit a more recent copy of your resume. Some Google recruiters will let your new resume be the only resume the Hiring Committee sees. Your resume you submitted for the online application probably wasn\u2019t customized for Google, but what you submit to the hiring committee can be.\n\nWhen the committee meets, they evaluate all the data on you holistically, and they need a consensus in order to decide to make a hire.\n\nOther than hire/no-hire decisions, the hiring committee will also decide on leveling. Ever since COVID and the rise of remote interviewing, we\u2019ve gotten more and more reports from users that they\u2019re being down-leveled at Google. Apparently the rationale is that Google doesn\u2019t feel like they get as much signal from remote interviews as they did from in-person ones, and as such, when they don\u2019t get enough of a signal for a hire but too much good signal for a rejection: they downlevel \u2013 when you want to reduce the probability of a false positives for L5\u2026 offer L4!\n\nEngineers who are downleveled at Google accept the lower level offer a lot of the time, especially in the current climate. In some extreme cases, we\u2019ve seen engineering managers with 10+ YoE accept an L3 (basically a new grad) offer.\n\nOnce you get past the hiring committee, you will move on to team matching. The team matching process is a bit like speed dating. In the ideal case, your recruiter will propose a few teams that are actively looking for someone with your skills, and then you\u2019ll meet with the hiring manager from each team to gauge cultural fit and chemistry. In order to move forward, both of you have to opt in.\n\nThat said, there are rare instances where a candidate will get past the hiring committee but then not find a team that they gel with.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n\u201cGetting five scores of \u2018Leaning Hire\u2019 is most likely to result in a \u2018No Hire\u2019 decision. I have seen many cases where the candidates got five scores of \u2018Leaning Hire\u2019, and the recruiter gave them positive feedback too, but the candidate got rejected. In these cases, every person the candidate dealt with directly (the interviewers) were positive, yet the hiring committee (the only people in the process who dealt with the candidate indirectly) rejected the candidate.\u201d\n\n## Google coding interview preparation resources\n\nHere are some tips for preparing for your Google coding interview:\n\n- Practice in teams; have someone make up a question. Then have them disguise it or plant a red herring in it (for example, purposefully have it look like Three Sum, but it isn\u2019t Three Sum).\n- Practice with someone who can change the parameters after you\u2019ve solved the main question by saying things like \u201cRemember that assumption X we made earlier. What would happen if we removed that assumption?\u201d\n- If you see a question online that has been marked as \u201cAsked in a Google interview\u201d, then it is not going to be asked in your interview, period. Google is very good at retiring questions that have been leaked.\n- Practice without the aid of an editor or IDE: in a Google doc, on a whiteboard, or with pen and paper.\n\nIn addition, we\u2019ve aggregated a bunch of useful Google content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Google interviewers, long-form solutions to common Google questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Google interviews.\n\n### Google interview replays\n\nBelow are a series of mock interview replays, conducted by Google interviewers on our platform.

They\u2019ve gotten very aggressive, and if you don\u2019t know the rules, you will fail.\n\nMeta\u2019s interview process and questions\n--------------------------------------\n\nMeta\u2019s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Call with a Meta recruiter\n*   Technical phone screen (and possibly a second technical phone screen)\n*   Onsite interviews\n\n![Image 1: Meta\u2019s interview process: recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fmeta-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Meta\u2019s hiring process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nMeta interviewers are guided by the company\u2019s current motto: move fast. All human groups have a metaphor they operate from. Meta isn\u2019t a family or an army. They\u2019re a well-structured Formula 1 team; they spend a lot of effort to put safeguards in place, and then they go pedal to the metal. At Meta, speed wins.\n\nAt Meta, because the process is centralized, you cannot interview with multiple teams concurrently like you can at some other tech companies. You get one shot on goal every ~3 to 6 months, depending on performance.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n\u201cIf you pass Meta\u2019s onsite, but don\u2019t take the offer your status of \u2018passed onsite\u2019 is valid for a year. If you don\u2019t take their offer and then choose to re-engage within that year, tell their recruiter \u2018I already passed the onsite\u2019 and push to get steps skipped because you usually can.\u201d\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nWhen interviewing at Meta, listen closely to the subtle clues and hints your interviewer gives you. Meta is the only FAANG where you can\u2019t become an interviewer unless you give good hints.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the previous section called [\u201cA note about recruiter calls\u201d](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls). Also [read our guide to negotiating with Meta](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-to-negotiate-with-meta). It starts at the recruiter call.\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone screen\n\nMeta's technical phone screen is a 45-minute coding interview that focuses on data structures and algorithms.\n\nAt the beginning of the interview, your interviewer will ask you a question or two about your resume and recent work that you've done. This portion will take 5 minutes, and how you answer these questions doesn't meaningfully factor into the interview's outcome - they are just meant to break the ice and get you talking. The part that matters is the technical portion.\n\nAfter the intro portion, your interviewer will ask you two coding questions, and they expect you to get through both in 35 minutes. These questions will be LeetCode easy or medium difficulty.\n\nMeta\u2019s technical phone screens are conducted in [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/). If you've never used it, you may want to [play around in their sandbox](https://app.coderpad.io/sandbox?_ga=2.197732077.314108963.1684799836-1650489622.1682112501&_gl=1*ijwnf5*_ga*MTY1MDQ4OTYyMi4xNjgyMTEyNTAx*_ga_XBQ5N5CE2N*MTY4NDc5OTgzNi40LjEuMTY4NDgwMDAzMi4xNC4wLjA.) and get familiar with their environment before your real interview. One specific thing about Meta's way of using CoderPad is that during the interview, they'll have code execution turned off - if you've used it before and are accustomed to testing your code during the interview by running it, you'll need to practice not being able to.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite interviews\n\nThe typical Meta onsite will consist of the following:\n\n*   At least two coding interviews\n*   Two system design OR product design interviews\n*   One behavioral interview\n\n#### Alternate Process for E6 engineers\n\nThe process for E6 engineers, as outlined in the diagram above, is slightly different. There will be a Leadership Assessment interview after the Technical Screen. In this interview, the following topics might be covered:\n\n*   Your current role, responsibility, and scope\n*   Cross-functional partnerships\n*   Situations regarding conflict resolution\n*   Solution skills\n*   How to drive results\n\nThe onsite for E6 engineers will also be different. You should only get one coding round, one architecture round, one design round and then a behavioral round.\n\nTypes of Meta interviews and what to expect\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThere are four main types of interviews you\u2019re going to encounter when you apply for an engineering job at Meta \u2013 coding interviews, behavioral interviews, and either a system design or product design interview. Here\u2019s what to expect during each of these rounds of interviews.\n\n### Coding interview\n\nMeta's process is highly standardized, so coding interview questions and themes tend to repeat. Coding questions are pre-approved, but that doesn\u2019t mean the interviewers have no freedom.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n\u201cMeta gives you the questions to ask or modify. But they don't tell you the answers in their interviewing wiki. And they let you design the path of the question: you get to ask your own twists and turns.\u201d\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some variance with the interviewer, but usually there are 20 mins per question, and the questions are simple. They want you to get the algorithm fast, and implement the basic solution. The kind of bugs that can be acceptable are empty input, and out of scope inputs like empty array/null. But an incomplete algorithm at Meta usually doesn\u2019t cut it. They want you to get to it and get to it quickly, and you can sacrifice making a little bit of a mess along the way.\u201d\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n\u201cI think there is a rule that during the programming interview, interviewers have to ask two questions. And the questions have to be balanced. The first is more like a juicy question testing problem solving skills and you as the interviewer can permit some bugs in the implementation. The second will be easy from the algorithmic point of view but the goal is to assess how much the candidate can write debugless code and test this code perfectly. And if a candidate fails to solve both problems, even if they somewhat shine during one problem: it will be \u2018No Hire\u2019.\u201d\n\nIt's not that bugs are encouraged, it\u2019s that they're the only company that's top-down directive is: sometimes, in certain rounds, bugs are okay. No other company does that. Meta relaxes the need for bug-free code so that candidates can code faster.\n\nFinally, Meta doesn\u2019t ask dynamic programming questions and, in fact, those questions are banned.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Meta\u2019s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Meta coding interview preparation resources](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/meta-facebook#facebook-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design OR product design interview\n\nMeta hires two types (on paper) of backend engineers: System Generalists and Product Generalists. System generalists get a system design interview, and product generalists get the confusingly named product design interview (in most other contexts, product design refers to UI/UX).\n\nWhich of these interviews you get is determined by your recruiter, based on your experience. If you have worked on a lot of product features, then you get a product design interview. If you have worked on high-scale distributed systems, then you get system design.\n\nThe product design interview at Meta is similar to the system design interview but with some key differences:\n\n*   System design focuses more on high level architecture and scale, while product design focuses more on interactions between services. For example, the expectations for API design in system design interviews is just high level arguments/data passed, whereas product design focuses more on the details, i.e., a more comprehensive list of arguments and response structure.\n*   Product design focuses more on how and what data flows through the entire system, between each service.\n*   Data models are weighted much higher in the product design interview than in system design. The expectation is to be more thorough and detailed.\n\nTake a look at this video, by Meta, about the difference between these two interview types:\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n\u201cProduct design is less databases, more data flow, more time spent on details of the API (e.g. parameters that will pass). System design is more databases, less API details, and more about scaling.\u201d\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n\u201cMany people think Meta only asks high level system design questions like \u2018Design Twitter\u2019 or \u2018Design Meta Feed.\u2019 But that\u2019s not the case. They also ask low level questions. In E6 or above interviews, you will most likely be asked \u2018Design Redis\u2019, or \u2018Design Kafka\u2019, or \u2018Design Memcached.\u2019 I\u2019d even seen rare occasions where E5 candidates would be asked low-level system design questions; low-level questions are less common in rounds for E5 and below.\u201d\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n\u201cYou have to ask about back of the envelope estimations. A lot of senior engineers hate to do that. I hate to do that as well. It\u2019s a waste of time. When I do the \u2018There is a rule that I have to do this. But there is no point in doing this. Let\u2019s spend 5 minutes talking about real system design. Let\u2019s assume we have to scale our system from 0 to Google level and therefore estimations are just a waste of time.\u2019\u201d\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nAsk your interviewer: \u201cDo you want to spend a few minutes on estimations? I\u2019m okay with skipping it, but if you need to see it, then let\u2019s do it. If we skipped it, one thing that might be a more interesting conversation would be spending a few minutes on how to scale this system.\u2019\u201d\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what to talk about in a E5 Meta system design round, talk about user experience. Go on about two choices you could make, then explain in depth the one preferred because it\u2019d be a better user experience.\n\nIt\u2019s also common for Meta interviewers to ask you to walk them through a system you\u2019ve worked on in the past, which is known as a reverse system design interview.\n\n### Behavioral interview\n\nUnlike technical questions, behavioral questions at Meta are not standardized: interviewers can ask you whatever they want. Behavioral rounds are of medium/low importance at Meta; they\u2019re less important than technical interview rounds, but they do carry some weight. For the best summary of what to expect in a Meta behavioral interview, read this [blog post by a former Meta engineering manager](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-software-engineering-behavioral-interviews-are-evaluated-meta) \u2013 in it he describes _exactly_ how behavioral interviews at Meta are evaluated and also includes a bunch of sample questions.\n\nHere is a list of questions to get you started. Read the post to get examples of good answers (split out by the candidate\u2019s seniority level!)\n\n*   \u201cWhat project are you most proud of and why?\u201d\n*   \u201cTell me about a recent day working that was really great and/or fun.\u201d\n*   \u201cTell me about a time when you wanted to change something that was outside of your regular scope of work.\u201d\n*   \u201cTell me about a time you had to make a fast decision and live with the results.\u201d\n*   \u201cTell me about a time when you needed to overcome external obstacles to complete a task or project.\u201d\n*   \u201cTell me about a time a project took longer as expected.\u201d\n*   \u201cTell me about a person or team who you found most challenging to work with.\u201d\n*   \u201cTell me about a time you disagreed with a coworker.\u201d\n*   \u201cTell me about a situation where two teams couldn\u2019t agree on a path forward.\u201d\n*   \u201cDescribe a situation when you made a mistake, and what you learned from it.\u201d\n*   \u201cTell me about some constructive feedback you received from a manager or a peer\u201d\n*   \u201cTell me about a skill set that you observed in a peer or mentor that you want to develop in the next six months.\u201d\n\nFinally, if you are applying for E5 and above make sure to have a couple of projects that lasted longer than one quarter \u2013 if all your examples are of smaller initiatives, your interviewer may walk away with the impression that you can\u2019t handle complex projects. Also, remember to quantify the impact that you made by sharing specific metrics.\n\nHow Meta makes hiring decisions\n-------------------------------\n\nMeta\u2019s candidate review and feedback process is usually completely asynchronous. Sometimes, they\u2019ll do a live debrief but it\u2019s rare. This means there\u2019s a low likelihood for an interviewer to \u201cfight\u201d for a candidate. Socially influencing interviewers won\u2019t go very far here.\n\nMeta is also the only FAANG that asks interviewers for a confidence score when filling out post-onsite feedback forms. As a result, the process at Meta can be more forgiving on failed rounds because a lower confidence score means a failed round carries less weight. Also, Meta is the only FAANG that directly asks interviewers about downleveling.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n\u201cCoding is used to decide \u2018Should we hire this person?\u2019 System and product design is used to decide \u2018How should we level this person?\u2019\n\nFor coding interviews, the interviewer says a binary score first: \u2018Hire\u2019 or \u2018No Hire\u2019. Then in the comments, they say how confident they are in that binary score. The \u2018Hire\u2019 or \u2018No Hire\u2019 is an official metric, but the confidence score is not.\n\nFor system/product design, the interviewer gives the \u2018Hire\u2019 or \u2018No Hire\u2019 first. Then they say if the candidate should be considered for another level.\n\nSo the final decision could be like: \u2018No Hire\u2019 for E5 with low confidence. \u2018Hire\u2019 for E4 with high confidence.\"\n\nIn cases where the hiring panel is hung, it\u2019s possible they may request one more follow-up interview to help them get more signal.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n\u201cInterview feedback is discussed primarily by the system design and behavioral interviewers, and those are the interviewers who have the most say regarding both the hire decision and a candidate\u2019s level. If interviewers don\u2019t feel like they got enough signal and the candidate ends up being on the fence, the recruiter will push for an additional round. Indicative hint: If you have an additional follow-up interview, your interviewers were probably split.\"\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n\u201cAt Staff level and above, it\u2019s a mandate that candidates can\u2019t get hired if they don\u2019t pass both system design rounds.\u201d\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n\u201cFor E6 and above candidates, if you fail one system design round but do well in the other rounds, you can get a mulligan. They can let you retake one system design round. But the same isn\u2019t true for behavioral: if you fail there\u2019s no mulligan. If you fail the behavioral round, it will be \u2018No Hire.\u2019\u201d\n\n'Team matching, offers, and \u201cBootcamp\u201d'\n---------------------------------------\n\nMeta made some changes to their process in 2023. Before, unlike at other FAANGs, you'd generally accept an offer before knowing with which team you'd end up on. Then you'd do a 6 week \u201cBootcamp\u201d, where you'd be trained on Meta's engineering infrastructure and systems. After the bootcamp, there would be a 2 week team-matching period.\n\nNow, after you finish the onsite, you jump straight to the team matching process. Team matching now happens BEFORE you get an offer, and offers are contingent on team matching completely successfully.\n\nYou'll talk with hiring managers from a number of teams to gauge fit and chemistry: we've heard that sometimes it's a handful, and sometimes it's over 10.\n\nAfter your team matching conversations, your recruiter will ask you to choose a team. In order to move forward, both you and the hiring manager have to opt in.\n\nOnce you make your choice, your recruiter will officially make an offer, and you'll usually have just a few days to make your decision. We hope this will change in the future, but recently Meta has been very aggressive with both offer timelines and with negotiations - they will not negotiate unless you can share competitive offer details from another top-tier company.\n\nOne other key difference between Meta's new process and the old one is what happens during Bootcamp. Historically, Bootcamp took 6 weeks, and in addition to training new hires on Meta's engineering infrastructure and systems, there'd be a multi-week \u201cspeed dating\u201d-esque team matching component.\n\nBootcamp still exists, but now it's much shorter - 2-4 weeks, and the focus is getting new engineers ramped up on generic tools. After that, new engineers will continue to ramp up on their specific teams.\n\nThe team matching process is a bit like speed dating. You meet with hiring managers to gauge fit and chemistry. In order to move forward, both of you have to opt in.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n\u201cWhen the market is good, you can talk to 20 different teams at the same time.\u201d\n\nThere are exceptions \u2013 some people with niche skills may get hired for a specific team before they start Bootcamp, but they still have to do the bootcamp period, just not the team-matching part afterwards.\n\nMeta coding interview preparation resources\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWe\u2019ve aggregated a bunch of useful Meta content for you!

Microsoft\u2019s interview process and questions\n\n## Microsoft\u2019s interview process and questions\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n- Recruiter call (and a hiring manager call from principal engineers and above)\n- Technical phone interview or Codility quiz\n- Onsite interviews\n- Team matching\n\n![Microsoft\u2019s interview process: recruiter call, technical phone screen or Codility quiz, onsite, team matching](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fmicrosoft-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Microsoft\u2019s process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nMicrosoft lets you interview with different teams at the same time; if you want to maximize your chances interview with several of them simultaneously.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s process is mainly (though not fully!) team-dependent. That means that while you interview for a specific team, you may not necessarily be interviewing *just* with people on that team. For example, sometimes you might interview with the hiring manager for a specific team, and your other interviewers will be individual contributors from other teams.\n\nEach team runs their own processes, which can vary quite a bit from team to team as well. Sometimes Microsoft bakes a quasi-team-matching activity into an interview process: where a candidate can meet multiple hiring managers in the same loop. Another variation is some candidates\u2019 first round screens are with a hiring manager instead of a recruiter.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [\u201cA note about recruiter calls\u201d](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Technical interview (phone screen or a Codility quiz)\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s technical phone screen is a traditional LeetCode-style coding interview, with technical questions ranging from easy to medium. Interviewers aren\u2019t given a rubric. Some of them get training, others don\u2019t. They have freedom to ask whatever they want and judge your technical skills however they want in this round.\n\nIf you end up getting the asynchronous [Codility](https://www.codility.com/) quiz instead, you sign on and have to answer several algorithmic questions in a short amount of time. In some ways, this is harder than the technical phone screen with the human because if you don\u2019t pass the test cases, you get filtered out. You\u2019re judged on several factors including: test cases, correctness, and code quality.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe onsite format can vary per org, but it typically includes the following round of interviews:\n\n- One behavioral round of behavioral interview questions\n- Two or three coding rounds\n- One system design round\n- One domain-specific round\n\n## Microsoft\u2019s interview types in detail\n\n### Coding\n\nThis is the most important round at Microsoft.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n\u201cSince most engineers at Microsoft use C#, if you can, you should use C#, Java, or Python in the technical rounds. This way, your interviewer will be able to understand your code better and may even be able to help.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft usually asks LeetCode-style medium-difficulty questions in coding rounds. Interviewers get to pick their own coding questions, but, according to interviewers, Microsoft favors the following topics (in no particular order):\n\n- Arrays and strings\n- Linked lists\n- Graphs and trees\n\n[LeetCode\u2019s Top Questions for Microsoft](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-microsoft-questions/) is also a helpful resource.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n\u201cTree questions are most popular, e.g., various types of tree sum, tree traversals of certain orders, subtrees, etc.\u201d\n\nDynamic programming used to basically never happen, but now it\u2019s a little more common. When you do get dynamic programming problems, it\u2019s usually the classic ones like coin change, stair steps, edit distance, and various types of counting problems.\n\nTooling for coding interviews is at the team\u2019s discretion, but many teams use Codility.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Microsoft\u2019s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Microsoft coding interview preparation resources](#microsoft-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design\n\nSystem design is tied for the second most important round at Microsoft, and it\u2019s sometimes conducted by a hiring manager. One idiosyncratic aspect of Microsoft\u2019s process is their penchant for asking questions about compliance-related topics.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n\u201cMy Microsoft interview was insanely easy. I tried to step it up when I started being an interviewer at Microsoft. But then I realized that's how it has to be. Technical is like 25% of it. It\u2019s not a generic FAANG interview. It\u2019s more about three things: a) \u2018How well does this candidate know this system they\u2019re going to be working on?\u2019, b) \u2018How do they meet the exact needs we have on this team?\u2019, and c) \u2018Do they understand the little things we value? Like compliance, manipulating data, data pipelines, EU data processing, etc.\u2019\u201d\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is obsessed with the details of compliance. I don\u2019t think I have seen a system that is as set up for auditing as Microsoft. Employees are asked to log so much. There\u2019s a centralized grid system which is built into Azure. All logs are to be routed into that. This allows for centralized log spanning and auditing. Which I have not seen anywhere else.\u201d\n\nOutside of compliance-related questions, here are examples of other system design questions you might encounter:\n\n- Let's go back in time, how would you ship cargo to customers? Discuss an approach that touches on availability, latency, reliability, communication, etc.\n- Let's say we are interested in palindromes and we want to store them durably whenever we come up with them. Design a system that lets you enter a new palindrome every time someone comes up with one, and allows users to check if a palindrome exists in a system.\n- Assume you are a teacher and you want to test students if they know the country names correctly. You are provided a list of countries and pictures. Design a webpage + backend API that mimics a test for students to evaluate their knowledge (this would be for a full-stack role).\n\nTooling for system design interviews is at the team\u2019s discretion, but many Microsoft employees use Codility Canvas or Excalidraw.\n\n### Domain-specific round\n\nThe domain-specific round is tied for the second most important round at Microsoft. Microsoft is more likely to do these types of rounds than other FAANGs, and these rounds can feel similar to system design but involve some coding.\n\nUsually, domain-specific rounds are customized to the domain a given team works on and dives deep into that technology. So, whatever area this team is in (cloud networking, big data, etc.), that\u2019s what they\u2019ll ask you about.\n\nOn some occasions, Microsoft customizes a round to the candidate\u2019s skills. For example, if you\u2019re a backend engineer, they might ask you to design an API or design a database. They also may ask you open ended trivia questions about the programming language you are most familiar with.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n\u201cAnother thing that happens in these rounds is they\u2019ll ask you to discuss a complicated problem you have solved at your job. It's good for candidates to prepare to discuss 2-3 projects in detail: how did they implement caching, deal with scaling issues, and so on.\u201d\n\nFinally, you may get a scenario question that\u2019s commensurate with your skill set. For instance, if you\u2019re a back-end engineer, you may get a question like, \u201cImagine you're in a team and we're building a credit card registration system. And it's used by different firms. How do you build the interface?\u201d\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis is the least important round at Microsoft: the lowest effort way to pass is to not blame your teammates, not show red flags, and stay positive.\n\nMicrosoft doesn\u2019t have a specific set of traits they\u2019re looking for. You can expect the usual questions about your strengths and weaknesses, failure, conflicts with colleagues, projects, and lessons you\u2019ve learned from past experiences in your career.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n\u201cA lot of people struggle with \u2018What are your top 2 strengths and weaknesses?\u2019 probably because they are trying to make up an answer on the spot. Good to prep answers to typical behavioral questions in advance.\u201d\n\nUltimately, they are screening for three soft skills: positivity, ownership, and communication. They want to hire friendly people who can do the work and not blame others. This is not Apple or Netflix, where they want a particular flavor of personality, or where they ask interviewers to hire candidates they\u2019d like to befriend. It\u2019s more neutral.\n\nBehavioral rounds can sometimes have a coding component as well. When this happens, it might be an easy/medium-difficulty 20-min LeetCode-style problem.\n\n## How Microsoft makes hiring decisions\n\nInterviewers grade candidates on different scales, depending on the team.\n\nSome orgs have an asynchronous feedback process, other orgs rely on live discussion, and still-other orgs do both. Some orgs have rubrics, and others don\u2019t. Here\u2019s how a rubric looks at one org:\n\n- Junior: Has growth mindset, seeks to understand ideas\n- Senior: Drives self development, models openness, failure is okay, open to different ideas\n- Principal: Consistently challenges group thinking towards productive discussion\n\n## Microsoft coding interview preparation resources\n\nHere are a few more interview tips and resources to help you prep for a software developer or software engineer interview at Microsoft.\n\n- Microsoft interviewers can ask whatever questions they want, yet some interviewers repeat questions, so [LeetCode\u2019s Top Questions for Microsoft](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-microsoft-questions/) is somewhat helpful.\n- Study up on the services the team you\u2019re interviewing with uses.\n- Ask your recruiter for specifics about your rounds. If you get nothing helpful, then practice practical questions, LeetCode-style questions, and domain-specific questions.\n\nIn addition, we\u2019ve aggregated a bunch of useful Microsoft content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Microsoft interviewers, long-form solutions to common Microsoft questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Microsoft interviews.\n\n### Microsoft interview replays\n\nBelow are a series of mock interview replays, conducted by Microsoft interviewers on our platform.

Apple's interview process and questions\n\n## Apple's interview process and questions\n\nApple\u2019s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n- Recruiter call OR online assessment\n- Technical phone screen (if you didn\u2019t do the online assessment)\n- Onsite interview\n\n![Apple\u2019s interview process: recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fapple-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Apple\u2019s hiring process, evaluation criteria, and interview experience.\n\nHumans in groups act out a chosen metaphor; Apple isn\u2019t a sports team. They\u2019re an army. Their army is made up of people obsessed with making great products. And they look to hire people who\u2019ve embedded Apple products into their lives. Armies reward loyalty more than sports teams. Apple also has the longest tenured employees in FAANG (we're including Microsoft with FAANG for the purposes of this guide).\n\nApple is decentralized and lets candidates interview with different teams concurrently; if you want to maximize your odds interview with as many teams as you have the appetite for.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n\u201cI interviewed with like 12 teams. I got 2 offers. Along the way, I told one of the Apple recruiter\u2019s I was interviewing for another Apple team and they shrugged it off; they didn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s interview process is more like what you might see at a startup than any other FAANG \u2013 from assigning which questions to ask to interviewer training to how hiring decisions get made. Significant inter-team variance is the norm, with each team essentially acting like a startup that\u2019s coming up with its own way of conducting interviews.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\nAt Apple, there\u2019s no formal interviewer training. It\u2019s very ad hoc. Every team is different. There is literally no process. What each of the teams does is rely on one of their very senior engineers or someone very experienced. Apple has a lot of people with long tenures, like 15 years. One of my colleagues had been there for 22 years. At Apple, the more senior you get the more the team trusts you to come up with your own questions. So what the interviewers at Apple typically do: you come up with a question that's not online, and you make sure it\u2019s relevant to what your team is doing. Then you pitch it to your manager or tech lead. Then you run with it.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n\u201cOne thing not enough candidates know about is this: there\u2019s no such thing as an Apple interview. You apply for a team. Not the company. When people ask me \u201cHow to prepare for an Apple interview?\u201d I say ask the recruiter. Because they usually know what types of questions are asked. The recruiter spends 30 minutes or an hour per debrief where engineers are talking about the details about the code. So if the recruiter is paying attention or is at least a little bit technical, they should have a clue whether it\u2019s LeetCode-style questions or embedded style questions. So ask your Apple recruiter a forced-choice question like, \u2018Is this interview more X or more Y?\u2019\u201d\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n\u201cI was one of the people to come up with a take-home assignment for candidates. Which was my favorite part of the process at Apple. We were hiring people for full-stack but not just any full-stack \u2013 we wanted people who were coding in Python on the back-end and a particular framework on the front-end. We cooked up a take-home which was a scaled down version of what they\u2019d be doing on the job: an internal tool built in those exact technologies. We gave them that take home and had them work on it for a week. Then we discussed it at the onsite where we\u2019d live-debug it and talk about architecture. I really liked this \u2018Try before you buy\u2019 style process. Because Apple really wants you to be productive in week 2, if not at the end of week 1.\u201d\n\nApple is the most likely to shock you; they\u2019re more likely to ask you something you didn\u2019t prepare for. Out of all the FAANGs, they\u2019re the ones you can expect to do something unexpected, and some of their tactics can seem mercenary. Apple is the only FAANG which sometimes has a process to cut interviews short if the candidate clearly isn\u2019t meeting the bar \u2013 if you don't perform above the bar for the first half of the interview, they\u2019ll cancel the rest.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n\u201cIf by the fourth round, the hiring manager has gotten consistent feedback that doesn\u2019t meet the bar, then they\u2019d end the onsite early and reject the candidate.\u201d\n\nApple is not results or process oriented. They\u2019re motivation oriented. In other words, they care more about the \u201cWhy\u201d than the \u201cWhat\u201d or the \u201cHow\u201d, and as such, they value behavioral interviews more than coding.\n\nApple employees are obsessed with privacy. It\u2019s not just marketing lip service. When asked if \u201cprivacy\u201d is a buzzword at Apple, our interviewers said\u2026\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n\u201cPrivacy isn't just a buzzword. We are obsessed with it. To drive that part home. Because it\u2019s so important. And as I mentioned, I was a part of a group focused on gathering user data - users here being Apple internal employees \u2013 to inform future products.\n\nEven at Apple, when we\u2019re just getting data from internal employees, we anonymized the data. Just to practice what we preach. Privacy is huge. Another example to illustrate that is that people get fired for torrenting music.\u201d\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n\u201cUnless you\u2019re interviewing for a security role, very rarely. Technical people at Apple are hired to do what they do best. They have a whole army of compliance folks and lawyers to take care of that stuff. They also have an internal police force called \u201cInfoSec\u201d, which is the team which takes care of the secrecy stuff. Engineers are needed to do what they were hired to do: engineering.\u201d\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [\u201cA note about recruiter calls\u201d](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls) for what to expect. We do encourage you to ask your recruiter what to expect for the rest of the process because as you\u2019ll see, there is a lot of variance from team to team.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\n\u201cAsk your Apple recruiter forced choice questions with two options, such as, \u2018Is this coding round more of a typical LeetCode round, or more of a domain-specific open ended deep dive into a specific technology?\u2019\u201d\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone interview\n\nLike everything else at Apple, the format and technical questions presented in Apple phone screens can vary a ton. Verify this by asking your recruiter!\n\nTechnical phone screens are coding interviews that range from 30 minutes to an hour. This tech interview may be between you and a single interviewer or sometimes a panel of interviewers. It may even be a hiring manager screen with a mix of behavioral questions and coding.\n\nIn any case, the general format is a shared coding environment where the interviewer(s) can assess your ability to utilize basic data structures and algorithms concepts. Being able to provide a solution for coding questions and quickly analyze the runtime complexity of your solution are key skills to have going into this interview.\n\nThe tooling used in Apple\u2019s technical interview rounds depends on the team you\u2019re interviewing with, but we\u2019ve heard that some teams use CoderPad.\n\n### (In some cases) Step 2.5: Take-home assignment\n\nSome teams give candidates a take-home assignment. They can give this around the same time they schedule a phone screen. The hiring manager is usually the person to decide whether or not candidates get one.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThere will be roughly six to eight in-person rounds of interviews, each of which will be with your future teammates. Each round will have least one, or possibly two, interviewers.\n\nNote that an onsite loop with one team at Apple will look very different than an onsite loop with another.\n\n## Apple\u2019s interview types in detail\n\nInterviewers can ask whatever behavioral, coding, or system design questions they want; there is no standardization for Apple interview questions. However, before an interview loop takes place, some teams will do a quick, informal assignment of what kinds of questions each interviewer is supposed to ask so that they don\u2019t all end up asking the same things.\n\nMoreover, Apple interviewers are untrained, and as soon as a senior engineer is hired they can start conducting interviews.\n\nApple\u2019s unpredictable nature makes it so some of their interview rounds can\u2019t be categorized into behavioral, coding, or system design. Is a philosophical question about products a behavioral question? Not really. But they might ask one in a behavioral round. Are rapid fire infrastructure-focused open-ended trivia questions more system design or coding? It depends.\n\nFor example, here\u2019s how one Apple interviewer describes the behind-the-scenes top-down directive before an upcoming onsite. \u201cGo find a question that would be a good one to ask for our team.\u201d That interviewer then ran it up the chain to an engineer above them. Then, that question immediately got asked in the next interview.\n\nAt Apple, each interview loop is specific to the needs of individual hiring managers \u2013 there is no canonical \u201cApple interview\u201d, and everything is \u201cmade to order\u201d for each specific team. That makes it difficult for candidates to prepare.\n\n### Coding\n\nSome teams at Apple prefer practical rounds. Sometimes, they\u2019ll have you write a program on your own laptop and IDE. Other times, they\u2019ll spend the whole round deep diving into a specific technology/use case that\u2019s relevant for their team. For example, a team that wrote in Java and did a lot of work with concurrency had a whole round focused on concurrency in Java!\n\nOther teams do medium-ish LeetCode-style questions.\n\nAt the end of the day, these interviews vary so widely it\u2019s hard to give a specific directive, other than: ask your recruiter. For senior and above candidates, it\u2019s more about demonstrating competence rather than needing to ace the question.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Apple\u2019s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Apple coding interview preparation resources](#apple-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design\n\nApple interviewers tend to ask questions relevant to a specific team\u2019s work. For instance, a team focused on building web services will tend to ask questions about that, while front-end teams may ask UI-related questions. It may be good to try to get a feel for the day-to-day work from the recruiter/hiring manager, as the job descriptions are not always the most helpful (remember: privacy!).\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIn system design rounds, Apple interviewers love to hear about reliability. If you don\u2019t know what else to talk about, dig into reliability.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nApple\u2019s most important round is usually behavioral or system design. Behavioral rounds are more important than coding rounds.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n\u201cIn behavioral, you gotta be a rockstar. You gotta be a leader. If you\u2019re abrasive, or if you\u2019re not a cultural fit, how are you going to lead the juniors? And system design is going to weigh a little more than behavioral. If you can\u2019t code or if you\u2019re a little rusty \u2013if you\u2019re good at system design and behavioral\u2013we\u2019ll forgive the subpar coding rounds.\u201d\n\nAn interesting paradox at Apple is: they highly value behavioral rounds but they don\u2019t have a standardized way to assess candidates in those interviews\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n\u201cTowards the end of my career at Apple, we had a huge need for mobile developers. People who were able to do iOS apps. I was part of an R&D team. We mainly built web products in the beginning, but towards the end of my career we started doing more mobile stuff. We didn't want to hire someone who could only do mobile. We wanted someone who would be half as good at mobile stuff and half as good at web stuff, so they could plug themselves in anywhere.\n\nIf the interview process was standardized across the whole company - you can imagine how hard that would be to test specifically for the niche skill set we needed. Within two days we cooked up a whole new homework assignment just for the ios candidates, we cooked up a whole new set of interview questions. We kept the behavioral part the same. But the technical part - we flipped it over just like that. And it was really good. We changed the way we graded, we were able to filter candidates based on the new set of questions. It was just fast. We didn't get any pushback from HR. We didn't have to work with compliance. We just did it. Really fast. Really nimble.\u201d\n\nBecause Apple doesn\u2019t standardize their interviews, they\u2019re particularly prone to bias. Sometimes the top down guidance to Apple interviewers is something like: \u201cIn the behavioral round, just see if you like them. See if you\u2019d like to get a beer with them.\u201d\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n\u201c[Interviews are never standardized.] And i\u2019ll tell you why. Apple is a very secretive company. Everything is on a need to know basis. Also, it's a hugely political place. It was good for me because I understood the game. I didn\u2019t blame the players I played the game. For those who understand the intricacies of politics, and simply accept the fact that it will happen when you have all Type-A people being paid a tremendous amount of money to do shitty little things, it's bound to happen. You have to accept it or you\u2019re not going to play the game. Everything at Apple is very siloed. Even when it comes down to the cost center. Everything is super independent of one another. That's actually one of the strengths and weaknesses of Apple. We double effort for sure. But that doesn't matter to Tim Cook. They have billions of dollars to afford this \u2013 not a problem. I also really liked how it was siloed because teams and their priorities change, leadership changes, a lot of things change. Being able to decouple from the greater company enabled them to become one of the biggest, if not the biggest tech company in the world.\u201d\n\nEven if rounds aren\u2019t standardized, you will definitely be asked \u201cWhy Apple?\u201d, and your answer needs to be on point. Some interviewers reject candidates solely for not having a good answer to this question. \u201cWhy Apple?\u201d isn\u2019t always a single question; they can spread this out into multiple questions and drill down on this for a good portion of a behavioral round. You can also expect other motivation-based (or \u201cwhy\u201d) questions.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n\u201cA common red flag is giving generic answers to the \u2018Why Apple?\u2019 questions. If I didn't feel their passion or if they\u2019re just treating Apple as another job, that\u2019s usually a red flag for me regardless of their technical competence. They really have to somehow convince me \u2013 and this is an emotional response they have to bring out of me \u2013 they really have to convince me they really want to work at Apple, they really want to roll up their sleeves, and they really believe in our values: delighting the customer, sweating the details. Making awesome products\u2026 We only care about that. We don't care about anything else. That emotional response has to be drawn from me and if they don\u2019t then I\u2019m likely to say, \u2018They were good but meh.\u2019\u201d\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n\u201cI can tell you about a great answer one candidate had for \u2018Why Apple?\u201d. He said something like\u2026 His wife and him were university students dating across two continents. This person said they shared a recent feature \u2013 I think it was like when you facetime and you can watch video in sync \u2013 he shared how that changed his life. His wife and him went through the whole international relationship because of that. That significantly helped their relationship.\u201d\n\nApple wants to hire candidates whose lives have integrated with the Apple products. And the reverse is true too. It's a fatal flaw to say, \u201cI've never used an iPhone or a Macbook or an iPad\u201d because those people clearly haven\u2019t integrated Apple products deeply in their lives.\n\nApple knows what they like, and they like their products! That doesn\u2019t mean all you have to do is gush about the products to pass the behavioral round. It means you have to tell a genuine story which connects you and Apple products or services. Ideally, a story they will remember.\n\nAnother behavioral factor debated among Apple interviewers is whether or not they agree with the idea that Apple is \u201ccult-ish.\u201d\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n\u201cApple cares most about the \u2018Why\u2019. You see that rooted deeply in every apple person's DNA. \u2018Why Apple?\u2019 Right? I guess this is where people get this notion of Apple being a \u2018cult-ish\u2019 company. Much like Tesla, actually. They have a huge customer following, but you also see the same pattern with their employees. Actually, I totally subscribe to this ideology. Because you want a person you work with day in and day out to have that same passion. Sometimes you're going to have to work overtime. You're not going to get paid extra for that. Sometimes you're going to work weekends. Sometimes shit\u2019s gonna hit the fan. You don't want to work with someone who whines about it.\n\nOur theory is that Apple is more likely to reward employees (and candidates) who act like the leader. [If you listen to 1:00:36 - 1:02:05 in an interview with Steve Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5f8bqYYwps&t=3636), you\u2019ll see some stark similarities to how Apple interviewers talk about the organization. In this clip, he says, \u201cYou know how many committees we have? None. We are organized like a startup.\u201d He then describes the benefits of silos and dividing things up.\n\nPrivacy and politics are the natural consequence of a place intentionally designed to be siloed and divided up and kept separate. It\u2019s a cost that Apple accepts because the gain is increased productivity. Put people in closed systems (teams and orgs that don\u2019t talk to other teams and orgs) and watch them get more done. This system works like blinders on a racehorse: it keeps vision focused down the track, on the goal, minimizing peripheral distraction. That\u2019s all they need to see and they run/work faster because of it.\n\nOne final aspect of Apple\u2019s behavioral rounds is that they will ask you specific questions about relevant skills. For example, if a team works with big data, they will ask specifically about a time you have worked with large-scale distributed systems in the context of your answer. If you don\u2019t have direct experience with the field, they will try to get as close as possible, like asking you for what tradeoffs you\u2019ve made when choosing a storage system. These behavioral interview questions serve two purposes: showing you have had relevant experience in the context of what the team is hiring for and trying to get you to talk about a particular behavioral skill (e.g., leadership, conflict resolution).\n\n## How Apple makes hiring decisions\n\nAs evidenced by the highest chaos score, Apple doesn\u2019t do many things in hiring consistently, across the whole company. One trend is that Apple teams rely on post-interview live discussions to make hiring decisions. This varies from somewhat informal (compared to the rest of FAANG) to laughably informal.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n\u201cPost-onsite feedback for my org was 100% live discussions. At Apple I never had to write feedback. Which made me do more interviews. We made the decision on the same day. Everyone had to make a decision at the end of the day. Do an onsite, then at 5pm, we gather in a single meeting room, we do on the count of three: thumbs up, down, or in the middle. Then we talk after seeing the thumbs. And try to convince the people on the other side. If there\u2019s less than 5 thumbs-up, then that might be an instant rejection. If there\u2019s 6 or 7 or more thumbs up, the \u2018thumbs up\u2019 people try to convince the other side. Or in that same situation, the 3 or 4 thumbs down will try to convince the other side.\u201d\n\nBecause of the informal decision-making process and reliance on live discussion, managing the impressions of your interviewers is more important at Apple than at other FAANG. In these decision-making meetings, if there\u2019s dissent, they strive for consensus. The people on one side try to convince the other side. This process can last 15-30 minutes on average; all FAANG companies say interviewers fight for candidates, but Apple tends to fight more than most of them.\n\nBecause of their patterns of live-discussions and striving for consensus, Apple interviewers are more likely to fight for or against you (if your performance was on the fence) than any other FAANG, except *maybe* Netflix.\n\nUltimately, the hiring manager for that particular role has the most say, which means that that\u2019s the person you should be working to impress the most.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n\u201cMy manager wanted to hire this person. But he failed my interview so badly. I didn't want to argue with my manager but at the same time I didn't want to work with this person. Because we are hiring people we\u2019d work with on a daily basis. So arguments happen a lot. And in this case, I was the only \u2018no\u2019 on the board and the candidate got rejected.\u201d\n\n## Apple coding interview preparation resources\n\nWe\u2019ve aggregated a bunch of useful Apple content for you!

It\u2019s more important to deeply research the service this team works on and build toy projects or answers about their service.\n- Before the technical rounds, ask your recruiter forced-choice questions with two options to determine the focus of the rounds.\n\n### Coding\n\n- Before the technical rounds, ask your recruiter forced-choice questions with two options to determine the focus of the rounds.\n\nWant to know if you\u2019re ready to interview at Apple?

You\u2019ll be asked to provide 3 different times that you\u2019re available so you can be more, or less, aggressive in how you approach it.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nAffirm\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s more about prep for the hiring process than anything else. You might be asked about your interest in Affirm, and they will likely talk about the role you are applying for.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nAffirm\u2019s technical phone screen lasts about an hour and is conducted in HackerRank.\n\nWe will cover what we know of their question style in the section called \u201cTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Affirm\u201d [below](https://interviewing.io/affirm-interview-questions#question-types).\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nYou can do the onsite section in one day or over two days.\n\n- **Behavioral** (45 mins). This is with the hiring manager of the team you are interviewing with. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/affirm-interview-questions#question-behavioral).\n- **Coding** (1 hour). This will be conducted in HackerRank. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/affirm-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **Second coding** (1 hour). As above.\n- **System design** (1 hour). This will also be conducted in Hackerrank. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/affirm-interview-questions#question-design).\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Affirm\n\n### Coding\n\nAffirm\u2019s coding questions are pretty straightforward and will be familiar to anyone practicing on LeetCode. You can commonly find them online. That said, their interviewers will try to put their own spin on questions \u2013 expect some variations, but if you can solve medium LeetCode problems, you should be fine.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in Affirm interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Affirm engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Binary Trees](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Matrices](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Stacks](/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1   \n interview replay](/mocks?technical=stacks)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Recursion](/recursion-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/recursion-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=recursion)\n\n### System Design\n\nThis round won\u2019t be a completely generic system design interview. It will usually relate to Affirm\u2019s business. Expect questions about databases, multiple layers of schema, and functional design.\n\nYou might be asked to design a system that enables transactions between two users via their bank accounts but that has certain constraints built-in e.g., they can\u2019t transfer more than what is in their account.\n\nTiming is important here. You won\u2019t have enough time to go into everything in detail. Try to cover everything at a high level, and ask your interviewer which areas would be most interesting to delve into more thoroughly.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nExpect the standard behavioral questions here. Questions like:\n\n- Have you ever felt pressure at work? How did you handle it?\n- When have you worked on a good team? Can you describe why it was good?\n- Have you ever received criticism from leadership at work?\n\nThis round is important as it is conducted by your potential manager. You can do well in the coding rounds but still fail out if you don\u2019t perform well in the behavioral interview.\n\n### How Affirm Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nAll the interviewers submit their feedback, and the decision is made by the hiring manager.\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Affirm?

There is also a huge emphasis on culture fit, much more so than at most other companies of their size and stage.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nAirbnb\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll ask you about your previous experience, why you\u2019re interested in Airbnb, and what you\u2019re looking for moving forward. They\u2019ll also review the specific role you\u2019re applying for to make sure you understand the expectations and requirements.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nGenerally, there\u2019s only one technical phone screen, but if your interviewer didn\u2019t get enough signal in the first one, you may be asked to do one more. Airbnb uses [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io) to conduct technical interviews, and in these interviews you\u2019re expected to write working code and run it \u2013 pseudocode is not allowed, and the expectation is that you\u2019re extremely proficient in your language of choice.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe onsite at Airbnb consists of 5-7 interview rounds with the following steps:\n\n- Coding (1-3 hours)\n- System design (1 hour)\n- Behavioral (1 hour)\n- Culture Fit (2 hours)\n\n#### Coding\n\nAs with the technical phone screen, you\u2019ll have to write working code and run it (no pseudocode). The number of rounds is dependent on your level, so more senior engineers will have less coding interviews, but more system design.\n\n#### System Design\n\nThis interview is similar to [Google\u2019s system design interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google).\n\n#### Behavioral\n\nThis interview will touch on your past projects, contributions, how you work in teams, and so on. The core engineering culture at Airbnb is all about making your mark and owning your impact.\n\n#### Culture Fit\n\nAirbnb calls these \u201cHost interviews\u201d, and they\u2019re conducted by non-engineers. These interviews are very important, even if you do well on the technical portion, fail these and you won't get an offer. They'll be evaluating whether or not you\u2019d be a good culture fit with everyone at Airbnb, and how you embody their values:\n\n- Champion the mission\n- Be a host\n- Embrace the adventure\n- Be a cereal entrepreneur\n\n### Step 4: Team matching\n\nOnce you\u2019ve passed your onsite, you can expect to speak with anywhere from 1 to 4 hiring managers. The hiring managers will try to sell you on joining their team, but will also use the time to decide if you\u2019re ultimately a good fit for their specific org.\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Airbnb\n\n### Coding\n\nAirbnb asks LeetCode-style questions, ranging from medium to hard difficulty.\n\nTo figure out what types of questions to expect in your Airbnb interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Airbnb interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you\u2019re likely to encounter:\n\n[Binary Trees](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Stacks](/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1   \n interview replay](/mocks?technical=stacks)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Queues](/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=queue)\n\n### System Design\n\nYou may get low-level or high-level questions in this round. Examples include:\n\n- Design a cache system\n- Design a voting system\n- Design Twitter's trending topics\n- Design a load balancer\n- Design Facebook Messenger\n- Design an auth platform\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n## Common Airbnb Interview Questions\n\nBelow are common questions that interviewers from Airbnb ask on our platform. Since our data comes from mock interviews, questions may not be exactly the same as what you'd see in real interviews.\n\nEASY\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Reverse String](/questions/reverse-string)\n\n[Write a program to reverse the given string.](/questions/reverse-string)\n\nEASY\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Two Sum](/questions/two-sum)\n\n[Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to a given target.](/questions/two-sum)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Find the Missing Number in an Array](/questions/find-missing-number-in-array)\n\n[Given an unsorted array of unique integers (size n + 1) and a first array identical to the second array, missing one integer (size n), find and output the missing integer.](/questions/find-missing-number-in-array)\n\n## How Airbnb Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nThere is a hiring committee for engineering positions at Airbnb, who will ultimately decide on leveling, but whether or not to extend the offer falls to the hiring manager. You can expect an offer to come within a week or so of successful team matching.\n\n## Airbnb Interview Replays\n\n[![Missing item list difference](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FPython_Airbnb_4_4146a1d87b.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAirbnb Interviewer\n\nMissing item list difference\n\nThe Legendary Artichoke, an Airbnb engineer, interviewed Mammoth Avenger in Python](/mocks/airbnb-python-missing-item-list-difference)\n\n[![Two sum](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FPython_Airbnb_1_1cc56d4ce3.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAirbnb Interviewer\n\nTwo sum\n\nRecursive Beast, an Airbnb engineer, interviewed Adequate Penguin in Python](/mocks/airbnb-python-two-sum)\n\n[![Missing item list difference](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FC_Airbnb_2_47260145b9.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAirbnb Interviewer\n\nMissing item list difference\n\nThe Legendary Artichoke, an Airbnb engineer, interviewed Supreme Werewolf in C++](/mocks/airbnb-cplusplus-missing-item-list-difference)\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Airbnb?

Help us write more guides like this one by [filling out this form!](https://iiosurveys.typeform.com/to/UVWQf8ZT) Get a free mock interview for your help.\n\nPublished: April 2, 2025\n\n## Anduril's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Anduril can expect the following process:\n\n- Recruiter call (30 minutes)\n- Technical phone screen AND/OR Hiring manager call (1 hour)\n- Onsite (4 hours)\n\n![Anduril\u2019s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen and/or Hiring manager call, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Anduril_interview_process_9764cd993a.png)\n\nAnduril has a hybrid process, which means that you might interview with a specific team or you might do team matching at the end. One engineer we spoke to who recently went through the process told us:\n\n> *They seem to tailor the interviewing process to what you say you\u2019re interested in at the company during the early rounds, so be careful about what you say you want. Stick to what you\u2019re good at.*\n\nFrom our conversations, it seems that in certain cases you do interview for a specific role, but you could end up on multiple teams depending on how the process goes. If you are interviewing for a specific role, we were told by another engineer that you should:\n\n> *Read up about their product and the relationship between the role and the product, they will ask questions very specific to the role and product.*\n\nSome of the engineers we spoke with had a hiring manager call instead of a technical phone screen, and some got both. More on that below.\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n- They might ask you how comfortable you\u2019d be working in the defense industry.\n- LeetCode practice will help, as their coding problems are at a LeetCode medium level, although they like to add practical elements too.\n- If you\u2019re going for a role that involves robotics, you need to know robotics in detail, particularly for L5/L6 level roles. They will press you to discuss the technical aspects of robotics even if your main question is more coding or system design based.\n- They don\u2019t tend to hire for remote roles.\n\nThe entire process takes about 3-4 weeks, and we\u2019ve heard it\u2019s more enjoyable than the typical FAANG style interview process. From one of our users who recently interviewed with Anduril:\n\n> *Their entire process seemed less formal than FAANG, more personable, more conversational.*\n\nThey seem to be OK to move at your speed through the process. We\u2019ve heard it can be done in as little as two weeks but that they don\u2019t have a problem with you slowing things down.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nAndurils\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll ask you about your previous experience, why you\u2019re interested in Anduril, and what you\u2019re looking for moving forward. They\u2019ll also sometimes ask you about your qualms, if any, about working in the defence industry.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen / Hiring Manager Call\n\nSometimes you\u2019ll get one or both of these. It seems to depend on the role you are interviewing for.\n\nIf you get the standard technical phone screen, you can expect LeetCode medium-level questions. It will be algorithms and data structures based, but they will put it into an Anduril context, e.g., drone management. One engineer told us:\n\n> *The question is not difficult algorithmically, but the follow-up questions in terms of how to speed and scale it up were trickier.*\n\nIf you end up getting the hiring manager call instead, the objective will be to show you are a fit for the role, technically speaking. They\u2019ll ask questions about your resume and experience before throwing in a coding question that is practical for the role in question.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThis will vary slightly by role but here\u2019s what you can expect.\n\n- **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/anduril-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **Second coding** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/anduril-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad or on a whiteboard if you go in person. They also sometimes use the whiteboard feature in Zoom. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/anduril-interview-questions#question-design).\n- **Behavioral** (1 hour). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/anduril-interview-questions#question-behavioral).\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Anduril\n\n### Coding\n\nThis will likely be algorithms and data structures-focused but will skew more practical than typical LeetCode questions. A sample question we heard was about a collection of robots, where they had tasks to perform, and you needed to keep track of the highest priority tasks. Others involved drone management or graph manipulation\n\nYou will have two coding rounds, and they\u2019ll be quite similar.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in Anduril. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Anduril engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Parsing](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1   \n interview replay](/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n[Sorting](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=sorting)\n\n### System Design\n\nYou might get a pretty industry standard question here, or it could be very practical, depending on the role you are interviewing for. Some of the standard questions we\u2019ve heard are:\n\n- Design Tinyurl\n- Design Tetris\n\nIf you get a more practical round, it might be related to managing drones in the field, where you have to get a signal from the drone and then send it back instructions. If you get a practical question, you need to be prepared to discuss the technologies, hardware included at least at a high level. The rounds for L5/L6 roles seem to skew more practical.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThe behavioral interview will be more conversational and less traditional than you might have seen at other companies. That said, it will still include the questions you\u2019d expect in a behavioral interview. They will go over your resume and ask you about projects you\u2019ve worked on in the past. Expect questions about the projects you\u2019ve worked on and areas like:\n\n- Their scale and scope\n- Technical challenges and how you solved them\n- Conflict that arose and how you handled it\n\nYou might also learn more about the type of projects they are working on for the team you are being matched with or interviewing for. If so you\u2019ll have the chance to ask questions, but you\u2019ll also be asked how you\u2019d see yourself fit into the role.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Help us write more guides like this one by [filling out this form!](https://iiosurveys.typeform.com/to/UVWQf8ZT) Get a free mock interview for your help.\n\nPublished: April 8, 2024\n\n## Anthropic's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Anthropic can expect the following process:\n\n- Recruiter call (30 minutes)\n- Coding challenge (60-90 mins)\n- Hiring Manager call (1 hour)\n- Onsite (4 hours)\n\n![Anthropic\u2019s interview process: Recruiter call, Asynchronous coding challenge, Hiring manager call, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Anthropic_interview_process_81881a3598.png)\n\nAt Anthropic, you interview for one of their two orgs: Research or Applied. Your interviewers will all come from that org. There is likely some flexibility in terms of which team in that org you end up on.\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n- Brush up on system design\n- Though Anthropic\u2019s coding questions are algorithmic, they tend to be more practical than the verbatim LeetCode questions that many companies use\n- Use a larger monitor for your coding Challenge \u2013 time is of the essence, and a laptop has limited real estate to view and write code\n- They don\u2019t give exploding offers and are very patient through the process\n- They use Python, and you\u2019ll need to be comfortable with it\n\nThe entire process takes about 3-4 weeks, and we\u2019ve heard it\u2019s very well thought out. From one of our users who recently interviewed with Anthropic:\n\n> *This felt so easy and thoughtful compared to all the other companies I interviewed with. They have their shit together. Efficient, thoughtful, won\u2019t waste your time. They move faster than expected!*\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nAnthropic\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll ask you about your previous experience, why you\u2019re interested in Anthropic, your understanding of Anthropic\u2019s value proposition, and what you\u2019re looking for moving forward. They\u2019ll also explain that they are a B Corp and cover what that means.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Coding Challenge\n\nWe\u2019ve heard that this can be done live or asynchronously. Most of the people we spoke to took a 90-minute take-home assessment in CodeSignal, but Anthropic's website says you might get a 60-minute live assessment, so it seems to be role-dependent. It won\u2019t be a LeetCode-style problem, but will still be pretty straightforward. You will be asked to complete a task that gets progressively more complex. One challenge we heard about was to implement a bank with multiple transaction types. You would have to build the core business logic for the application. We\u2019ve heard that candidates tend to run out of time in this round, so manage your time carefully.\n\nOne engineer who took the take-home assessment told us that:\n\n> *The screening was conducted on Code Signal, consisting of a general specification and a black-box evaluator. There were four levels. The spec would get more complicated at each level, and your code had to pass all the tests at one level to get to the next level. All in two hours.*\n>\n> *The verbal spec was straightforward. No special algorithmic knowledge was needed. But the spec interpretation could only be obtained by repeatedly running your code to see what test cases failed.*\n>\n> *Makes me think the folks who go to the next level are probably good at reading ambiguous specs and trying out theories against black-box graders.*\n\n### Step 3: Hiring Manager Call\n\nThis is mostly a technical call and is usually split into two parts. You will be asked to talk about (1) a project you\u2019ve completed and (2) review code examples in different programming languages. You\u2019ll be asked to detect issues and recognize what task the code is used for.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nThis will vary slightly by role but here\u2019s what you can expect.\n\n- **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CodeSignal. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section](https://interviewing.io/anthropic-interview-questions#question-coding) below.\n- **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in the drawing tool of your choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section](https://interviewing.io/anthropic-interview-questions#question-design) below.\n- **Second coding (role-specific)**(1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section](https://interviewing.io/anthropic-interview-questions#question-coding) below.\n- **Behavioral** (1 hour). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section](https://interviewing.io/anthropic-interview-questions#question-behavioral) below.\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Anthropic\n\n### Coding\n\nThis will likely be algorithms and data structures-focused but will skew more practical than typical LeetCode questions. A sample question we heard was about iterating over and debugging a call stack.\n\nMost coding rounds are carried out in a shared Python environment, so you\u2019ll need to be comfortable with the syntax and standard library. Some roles will incorporate Machine Learning elements but only in one of the coding rounds and you can pass on that if you\u2019d like. You do not have to know anything about machine learning to interview with Anthropic as an engineer.\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in Anthropic interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Anthropic engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s a list of more niche technical topics that are, in our experience, specific to Anthropic:\n\n- Data mutation\n- Concurrency\n\nAnd here are technical topics that you\u2019re likely to find at other companies as well (for these we\u2019ve created detailed write-ups of their own):\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Parsing](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1   \n interview replay](/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Sorting](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=sorting)\n\n### System Design\n\nAs with the other interviews, expect something practical here. It will very likely be related to an issue that Anthropic has encountered before. You might be asked to:\n\n- Design a system that enables a GPT to handle multiple questions in a single thread\n- Design a Claude chat service\n- Design a banking app\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis will be more conversational and less traditional than you might have seen at other companies. Expect questions about AI in areas like ethics, data protection, safety, the job market and knowledge sharing.\n\n### How Anthropic Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nDecisions are reached by consensus (everyone agrees to hire or no-hire), but in cases where consensus isn\u2019t possible, the hiring manager has final say.\n\nSee something inaccurate? Please fill out [this form](https://iiosurveys.typeform.com/to/LXqccdMk), and tell us about it.\n\n![Interview Problems](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2FHeroImage.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n## About interviewing.io\n\ninterviewing.io is a **[mock interview practice platform](/)**.

Help us write more guides like this one by [filling out this form!](https://iiosurveys.typeform.com/to/UVWQf8ZT) Get a free mock interview for your help.\n\nPublished: June 16, 2024\n\n## Atlassian's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Atlassian can expect the following hiring process:\n\n- Recruiter call (30 minutes)\n- Technical phone screen (1 hour)\n- Onsite (4-5 hours)\n\n![Atlassian\u2019s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Atlassian_s_Interview_Process_f7d2fec3b4.png)\n\nAt Atlassian, the process is centralized, meaning you won\u2019t do team matching until after the onsite phase. You\u2019ll be interviewed by people from different teams during the interview loop.\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n- Their coding questions are discoverable online \u2013 they have a set bank that they use\n- You can use any language for the coding rounds and your own IDE\n- They have published their own [guide to the engineering hiring process](https://www.atlassian.com/company/careers/resources/interviewing/how-to-nail-your-engineering-interview)\n- They hire remotely, but salaries are location-specific\n\nThe entire process takes about 4-6 weeks.\n\nAn engineer familiar with their hiring process told us that Atlassian\u2019s \u201c[Chaos Score](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process#the-chaos-score) is very low, i.e., there is a high level of consistency in terms of process and outcomes for different candidates.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nAtlassian\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll ask you about your previous experience, why you\u2019re interested in Atlassian, and how the teams you\u2019ve worked on before have been structured. They\u2019ll also discuss the possible roles that are available.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen via Karat\n\nAtlassian uses a third-party interview service called Karat to conduct the technical screen that comes before the onsite. This seems to be true for most engineering roles but not all. If you haven\u2019t been interviewed by Karat before, you\u2019ll be interviewed by an engineer who does NOT work for Atlassian but who\u2019s getting paid by Karat to conduct interviews on their behalf.\n\nIf you are interviewing for a backend or full stack engineering role, you\u2019ll get a coding question. It will be a LeetCode-style, medium-level question selected from Atlassian\u2019s question bank. You can find examples of the types of questions they ask online.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t interviewing for a backend or full stack engineering role, we\u2019ve heard that this can be a coding round OR a system design round and may be conducted by an Atlassian engineer, rather than an outsourced third party like Karat. If that ends up being the case, you will be able to use your own IDE or tooling, whatever language you\u2019d prefer, and even any developer tools you use during your day-to-day, outside of AI technologies.\n\nIf you get a system design round, you might be asked to design something like a task list or job scheduler. You\u2019ll be able to use any tooling you\u2019d like to build the system. It\u2019s really important to show how you are thinking about the problem by asking good questions, discussing tradeoffs and constraints, and mentioning both technologies and internal partners you might use to achieve your goal.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThis will vary slightly by role but here\u2019s what you can expect during the back-end and full-stack hiring loops.\n\n- **Coding x 2** (60 mins each). These interviews will be conducted in your IDE of choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section](https://interviewing.io/atlassian-interview-questions#question-coding) below.\n- **System design** (60 mins). This interview will be conducted in the drawing tool of your choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section](https://interviewing.io/atlassian-interview-questions#question-design) below.\n- **Values** (45 mins). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Values section](https://interviewing.io/atlassian-interview-questions#question-values) below.\n- **Manager interview** (60 mins) For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Manager interview section](https://interviewing.io/atlassian-interview-questions#question-manager) below.\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Atlassian\n\n### Coding\n\nAtlassian has a bank of questions that they use for coding rounds, and you can find examples online. Except something that feels like a LeetCode medium-level question.\n\nThey are trying to test out how you would approach a problem if you encountered it at work, so you\u2019re able to use the language and tooling you are comfortable with. They are assessing you based on 5 key criteria:\n\n1. Code Quality: Clean up your code as you go and act as if it is eventually going into production.\n2. Adaptability: Be prepared to be given additional requirements to incorporate as you go and be open to change when it makes sense.\n3. Conceptual Thinking: Break down the problem in components and discuss it in conceptual terms before you start to solve it.\n4. Decision Making: They put more focus on why you approach a problem from a certain angle than whether you solve it. Discuss the pros and cons of your decisions.\n5. Resourcefulness: They want to see how you use your experience and other resources to solve problems when needed.\n\nBe prepared to discuss how to scale your solution as well!\n\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in Atlassian interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Atlassian engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Priority Queues](/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 3   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=priority-queues)\n\n[Search](/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=search)\n\n[Parsing](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1   \n interview replay](/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Sorting](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=sorting)\n\n### System Design\n\nAgain, you can use any tooling you\u2019d like for this round. You might be asked to:\n\n- Design a job scheduler\n- Design a task list\n- Design a tagging system\n\nThis is a pretty standard system design interview. You won\u2019t need to code anything and the focus will be on how you would build the system and the tradeoffs, considerations and optimizations that might be involved.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Values\n\nThis interview can be conducted by anyone at the company. You might talk to someone from Marketing, Sales or any other department. It will feature scenario-based behavioral questions. They prefer the STAR framework for answering questions, so brush up on that methodology. It\u2019s a good idea to review [Atlassian\u2019s values](https://www.atlassian.com/company/values) and incorporate them into your answers. Expect questions about how you\u2019ve handled giving and getting feedback, how you\u2019ve worked on teams, etc.\n\n### Manager Interview\n\nThis is another behavioral interview, this time with an engineering manager, and it will be a deep dive into a past project you\u2019ve worked on with a team, so be sure to prepare. The types of questions that you get here will focus on things you learned while working as part of a team and the scale and scope of your impact. They will ask questions around conflict resolution, the lessons you\u2019ve learned, how you\u2019ve mentored others, and how you were able to drive outcomes. Again, knowing Atlassian\u2019s values, and incorporating them into your answers will help.\n\n### How Atlassian Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nDecisions are made by a hiring committee. We don\u2019t have a lot of information on their process but we do know that they sometimes ask you to complete an additional round if you didn\u2019t quite meet the bar during the onsite.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Help us write more guides like this one by [filling out this form!](https://iiosurveys.typeform.com/to/UVWQf8ZT) Get a free mock interview for your help.\n\nPublished: June 26, 2023\n\n## Square's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Block/Square (from now on we'll refer to them as Square) can expect the following process:\n\n- Recruiter call (30 minutes)\n- Technical phone screen (1 hour)\n- Onsite (4-5 hours)\n- Team matching\n\n![Square\u2019s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite, Team matching](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Square_s_Company_Process_fe968457a9.png)\n\nSquare\u2019s hiring process is a hybrid. Although you apply for a specific team from the get-go, your interviews will likely not be with the people on your team \u2013 interviewers are randomly selected from a pool \u2013 except for the hiring manager interview.\n\nNote: Square is one of the few companies that will actually give you some constructive post-interview feedback!\n\nThe entire process takes about 6 weeks, based on our sources.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nSquare\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll ask you about your previous experience, why you\u2019re interested in Square, and what you\u2019re looking for moving forward. They\u2019ll also review the specific role you\u2019re applying for to make sure you understand the expectations and requirements.\n\nIt\u2019s really important to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nSquare\u2019s technical phone screen lasts about an hour. In rare cases, they will let very senior candidates skip this step. In this interview, you\u2019ll pair with your interviewer on a coding problem in [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io).\n\nAfter this round is over, you\u2019ll get high-level feedback about your performance from your recruiter, regardless of outcome (e.g., you might get feedback about your coding speed, your attention to detail, and so on).\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe onsite at Square consists of 4-5 sessions, depending on the role and experience level of the candidate. Most of the interviews, except for the hiring manager interview and the coding rounds, are two-person panels. If you\u2019re a mid to senior-level engineer, you can expect the onsite to look something like this:\n\n- Coding (2 hours)\n- System design (1 hour)\n- (For L6+) Leadership interview (1 hour)\n- Hiring manager interview (30 minutes)\n\n#### Coding\n\nSquare\u2019s onsite includes two separate 1-hour coding interviews, conducted in [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io).\n\n#### System Design\n\nThis round is conducted by a two-person panel.\n\n#### (For L6+) Leadership Interview\n\nThis round is conducted by a panel of two very senior engineers (both will be L6 and above).\n\n#### Hiring Manager Interview\n\nThis is a call with a hiring manager from the team you\u2019d be working on. For more junior engineers, it usually takes the form of a \u201cTeach me something technical\u201d. For more senior engineers, it\u2019s usually a deep-dive into a relevant project you\u2019ve worked on in the past.\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Square\n\n### Coding\n\nCoding questions at Square are practical, e.g., \u201cBuild an app to split a bill with friends\u201d, rather than LeetCode-style. Square has a question bank with approved questions that interviewers can pull from, and they can submit their own questions to it as well, though there\u2019s a rigorous review process:\n\n- You propose your question\n- It gets approved by other interviewers\n- You try out your question in the wild, and it gets shadowed as well\n- Once it\u2019s fully approved, it goes into a company-wide question bank\n\nInterviewers are also encouraged to layer complexity in their interviews, and a question that might start out simple can go to unexpected places.\n\nSquare\u2019s questions, while practical, may touch on the following technical topics/concepts, as you\u2019ll need them to build whatever it is your interviewer tasks you with:\n\n[Binary Trees](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Sets](/sets-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/sets-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=sets)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Hash Tables](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-tables)\n\n[Queues](/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=queue)\n\n### System Design\n\nThese will likely be high-level [system design questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview), and though it\u2019s now retired, one of the more common system design questions at Square was \u201cDesign a Hotel booking system\u201d.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n## Common Square Interview Questions\n\nBelow are common questions that interviewers from Square ask on our platform. Since our data comes from mock interviews, questions may not be exactly the same as what you'd see in real interviews.\n\nHARD\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Binary Array Partition](/questions/binary-array-partition)\n\n[Given an array Z of 0s and 1s, divide the array into 3 non-empty parts, such that all of these parts represent the same binary value.](/questions/binary-array-partition)\n\n## How Square Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nAfter each round, interviewers leave feedback and makes a hire or no-hire recommendation. Those are then collected and sent to the hiring manager, who will decide whether to \u201cplead your case\u201d in front of the Hiring Bar (Square\u2019s version of a hiring committee).\n\nNote that you can get mixed feedback from your interviewers and still get moved forward. It really depends on what the hiring manager needs and what they can justify.\n\nSquare\u2019s Hiring Bar is composed of 3 people \u2013 either eng managers or senior engineers. Your hiring manager takes your resume and interview results and explains why you\u2019d be an asset to their team. Then the Hiring Bar votes, and if you get at least 2 of the 3 votes, you get an offer.\n\n## Square Interview Replays\n\n[![Threaded order of execution](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FPython_Square_1_5015750c0d.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBlock/Square Interviewer\n\nThreaded order of execution\n\nEponymous Squirrel, a Block/Square engineer, interviewed Dystopian Sphinx in Python](/mocks/square-python-threaded-order-of-execution)\n\n[![Sleep sort](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Square_2_08692ecf13.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBlock/Square Interviewer\n\nSleep sort\n\nEponymous Squirrel, a Block/Square engineer, interviewed The Phenomenal Lemur in Java](/mocks/square-java-sleep-sort)\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Block/Square?

Each team asks its own questions, focuses on different things, and might have slightly different processes \u2013 for instance, some teams don\u2019t ask any system design questions.\n\nLike many other decentralized companies (e.g., [Amazon](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)), you can apply to and interview with multiple teams simultaneously. However, all teams have access to the same applicant tracking system, so it\u2019s possible that if you\u2019ve done poorly with many teams already, subsequent teams may decline to interview you. From what we\u2019ve heard, however, there\u2019s no real downside in hedging your bets and talking to as many teams as possible.\n\nIf you do decide to interview with multiple teams, you\u2019ll have to repeat the entire process below every time.\n\nGeneral tips for your Bloomberg interviews:\n\n- Do lots of algorithms and data structures practice\n- Be ready to interview in Java or C++\n- Read up on what Bloomberg does before your interviews, and have a good answer for Why Bloomberg?\n\n![Bloomberg\u2019s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Bloomberg_s_Company_Process_6b61d23f61.png)\n\n## Bloomberg\u2019s Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Bloomberg can expect the following process:\n\n- Recruiter call (30 minutes)\n- Technical phone screen (1 hour)\n- Onsite (4 hours)\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nBloomberg's recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll ask you about your previous experience, why you\u2019re interested in Bloomberg, your understanding of Bloomberg\u2019s value proposition, and what you\u2019re looking for moving forward. They\u2019ll also review the specific role you\u2019re applying for to make sure you understand the expectations and requirements and go over the hiring process.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nBloomberg\u2019s technical phone screen lasts about an hour and is conducted on Zoom and HackerRank. Algorithms and data structures are typically the areas of focus. Unlike at many other companies, you will not be running your code during the interview, so it\u2019s OK if it\u2019s not syntactically perfect, as long as it\u2019s efficient and largely correct.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe Bloomberg hiring process is all virtual, and they break the onsite up into individual sections \u2013 once you get through the first technical phone screen, you are essentially at the onsite phase but will have to pass each interview to get to the next.\n\nDuring the virtual onsite, you will use Zoom and HackerRank for all the sessions. The topics will vary team by team, so you may get system design questions or algorithms & data structures questions during the technical rounds, or a combination of both. It is possible to only get coding questions and not have to do any system design \u2013 the details vary from team to team.\n\n- **Technical interview** (1 hour). Just like in the phone screen, you won\u2019t have to run your code. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the \u201cTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Bloomberg\u201d section [below.](https://interviewing.io/bloomberg-interview-questions#question-types)\n- **Technical interview** (1 hour). As above.\n- **Behavioral interview** (1 hour). This will be a test of your soft skills by the HR team. Cultural fit is very important to them, so have a well-thought-out answer as to why you want to be there.\n- **Final interview with a senior manager** (1 hour). This will be your final interview and it will be conducted by a senior manager, someone who manages at least 50 engineers at Bloomberg. Some of the questions may be technical, others behavioral. Details depend on both the manager and the team.\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Bloomberg\n\nEach team has its own questions, and there is no central bank. Some teams only ask coding questions, but others will mix in system design questions. Your questions might be in C++ or Python depending on the team. Most teams at Bloomberg use C++. Senior people should know C++ going in, though Java also works. Not knowing either of these languages isn\u2019t a deal-breaker, but it can be a tiebreaker when deciding between two candidates who did well otherwise.\n\n### Coding\n\nAs there is no central bank of questions, each team and each interviewer will pull questions from elsewhere. This could be from LeetCode, previous companies they\u2019ve worked at, or questions they\u2019ve seen before at Bloomberg.\n\nMostly, you should expect standard algorithms and data structures questions in this round. To figure out what technical topics might come up in your Bloomberg interviews, we did 2 things. First, we spoke to some current and former Bloomberg interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you\u2019re likely to encounter.\n\n[Binary Trees](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Linked Lists](/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=linked-lists)\n\n[Binary Search](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Depth-First Search (DFS)](/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=depth-first-search)\n\n[Breadth-First Search (BFS)](/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=breadth-first-search)\n\n[Sorting](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=sorting)\n\n### System Design\n\nSystem Design questions at Bloomberg tend to skew practical and tend to be finance-related. For instance, you might be asked questions such as: How would you design a stock exchange?. Unlike other companies, you might be asked to write code during this interview.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis will be a pretty standard behavioral interview conducted by someone from the HR team. Expect questions about your past experience and some situational scenarios, e.g., *How would you handle conflict in the office?*\n\nIt\u2019s also very important to do your homework and read up on Bloomberg and what they do, so you can effectively answer questions about why you want to work there.\n\n### How Bloomberg Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nTheir interviewing team will sync after each stage of the onsite process and do a debrief. This will determine whether or not you pass through. It\u2019s possible to be sent home after any of the onsite rounds.\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Bloomberg?

This is a recent change \u2013 before that, you had to apply separately to each team. Now, everyone enters the same standardized process, and team matching happens at the end.\n\nOnce you apply, a hiring manager will review your information and coding assessment to decide if they want to invite you for the virtual onsite (aka Power Day). If there are multiple hiring managers interested, you\u2019ll have an opportunity to chat with them after your onsite and make a choice of team.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nThis is a typical recruiter call, where they\u2019ll ask about previous experience, relevant projects, and why you\u2019re interested in Capital One. They\u2019ll also elaborate on the role and confirm that your experience and expectations are a good match.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter). Just don\u2019t do it \u2013 when you give out information this early in the process, you\u2019re painting future\u00a0you into\u00a0a corner.\n\n### Step 2: Online Assessment\n\nCapital One\u2019s online assessment consists of three LeetCode-style algorithms and data structure questions: one easy, one medium, and one hard, administered via CodeSignal. You get 1.5 hours to complete it.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite aka \u201cPower Day\u201d\n\nCapital One\u2019s onsite lasts roughly 4 hours and consists of the following steps:\n\n- Coding (1 hour)\n- System design (1 hour)\n- Behavioral (1 hour)\n- Case study (1 hour)\n\n#### Coding\n\nThis interview takes about an hour and focuses on algorithms and data structures. You\u2019ll share your screen with the interviewer (usually over Zoom) and code in whatever environment you usually work in. Capital one\u2019s preferred languages are JavaScript, Java, TypeScript, Python, and Go.\n\n#### System Design\n\nThis is a one hour interview. The expectation here is that you\u2019ll be able to go in-depth on your design choices and that your design needs to be as functional as possible, given the interview time allotted. One common mistake we heard about from one of our interviewers at this step is that people get hung up on trying to perfect a small piece of their solution instead of getting to an end-to-end solution that works. With that in mind, make sure that you\u2019re able to articulate your assumptions and call out any shortcomings in your design.\n\n#### Behavioral\n\nThis interview can either happen live, in which case it lasts one hour, or in some cases it\u2019ll be an asynchronous online assessment. In both cases, it\u2019s pretty standard behavioral fare \u2013 you\u2019ll get questions with the expectation that you\u2019ll answer using the [STAR format](https://capd.mit.edu/resources/the-star-method-for-behavioral-interviews).\n\n#### Case Study\n\nIn this interview, you\u2019ll be presented with a hypothetical situation and asked to develop a solution to the underlying business problem. This interview evaluates your communication skills and business sense, as well as your ability to think logically and quantitatively. It\u2019s important to be aware of [Capital One\u2019s values](https://www.capitalonecareers.com/culture)\u00a0and incorporate them into your responses.\n\n### Step 4: Team Matching\n\nOnce you finish your onsite, your interviewers will submit their hire/no hire recommendations.\u00a0If you were matched with only one team, you\u2019ll be extended an offer. If you matched\u00a0with multiple teams, you\u2019ll have a brief chat with each of the hiring managers, so that you have an opportunity to decide where to go, at which point the offer will be extended officially.\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Capital One\n\n### Coding\n\nThis interview usually has two medium-difficulty LeetCode-style questions.\n\nTo figure out what types of questions to expect in your Capital One interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Capital One interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews.

While there\u2019s a general focus on high-level system design, some interviewers will let you choose the focus (OOD, UI, etc.). The most popular question we\u2019ve heard about is \u201cDesign a banking system\u201d.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n## Common Capital One Interview Questions\n\nBelow are common questions that interviewers from Capital One ask on our platform.

This means you can interview with multiple teams although they sometimes allow you to skip stages if they feel like they\u2019d be duplicating their efforts. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any downside to interviewing for more than one role at a time. In fact, if you end up interviewing for multiple teams, you may be able to skip steps (e.g. not have to repeat CodeSignal).\n\nA good way to get into the process with Coinbase is to find a role you like and then track down the lead recruiter or hiring manager aligned to it on Linkedin. Recruiters will also share candidates they like with other teams if they don\u2019t have a slot open on their specific team.\n\nGeneral tips for your Coinbase interviews:\n\n- It\u2019s OK to reach out to your recruiter or hiring manager contact to ask questions\n- If you feel like there was some miscommunication during an interview, be proactive and reach out to the recruiter afterward to clear things up\n- Apply for the right level and don\u2019t be too aggressive \u2013 it\u2019s better to secure a role at a lower level than to fail out of a higher one.\n\n![Coinbase\u2019\u2019s interview process: CodeSignal assessment, Recruiter call, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/coinbase_process_flowchart_6439ce881a.png)\n\n## Coinbase\u2019s Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Bloomberg can expect the following process:\n\n- CodeSignal assessment (70 minutes)\n- Recruiter call (30 minutes)\n- Onsite (3 hours)\n\n### Step 1: CodeSignal Assessment\n\nThis is an asynchronous challenge focused on data structures and algorithms. As of the date of publication, it includes 4 questions for you to work on. The first one is usually a warm-up. The others are LeetCode medium-level.\n\n### Step 2: Recruiter call\n\nCoinbase\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll ask you about your previous experience, why you\u2019re interested in Coinbase, your understanding of Coinbase\u2019s value proposition, and what you\u2019re looking for moving forward. They\u2019ll also review the specific role you\u2019re applying for to make sure you understand the expectations and requirements and go over the hiring process. Once you pass this stage you\u2019ll enter the team pipeline.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe Coinbase onsite is usually done over two days and includes three, one-hour long interviews. You\u2019ll do two technical interviews and one final call with a hiring manager. For the technical portions, you can use your own IDE with a screen-share, or they can provide tooling.\n\n- **Technical interview** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the \u201cTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Coinbase\u201d section [below](https://interviewing.io/coinbase-interview-questions#question-types). You can typically use whatever language you want, although a few teams do require you to use a specific language.\n- **System design interview** (1 hour).

Many questions involve setting up microservices and then showing the network topology of your chosen architecture. Basically, they will want to test your understanding of microservice architecture but through the lens of building a product.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Hiring Manager Interview\n\nThis will be your final interview, and it will be conducted by a hiring manager. You\u2019ll likely be asked some culture fit/behavioral questions, but at this point, the hiring manager will also be trying to sell you on the role.\n\n### How Coinbase Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nTheir interviewing team will all meet after the onsite and give their feedback to the hiring manager, who will make the decision. A director will then review the decision and has the power to veto, but this very rarely happens.\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Coinbase?

Help us write more guides like this one by [filling out this form!](https://iiosurveys.typeform.com/to/UVWQf8ZT) Get a free mock interview for your help.\n\nPublished: April 22, 2025\n\n## Databricks's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Databricks can expect the following process:\n\n- Recruiter screen (30 minutes)\n- Technical phone screen (1 hour)\n- Hiring manager call (1 hour)\n- Onsite (spread across 4-5 hours)\n\n![Databricks's interview process: Recruiter screen, Technical phone screen, Hiring manager call, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Databricks_interview_process_a0fc569fb6.png)\n\nDatabricks has a hybrid hiring process. Candidates are typically matched to a specific part of the organization early on, and you'll interview for a specific role, but your interviewers will not necessarily be people from your future team. There is also scope to switch roles after the onsite. According to our sources, about a quarter of candidates pivot to another team after completing their onsite interviews.\n\nThe entire process can take up to 8 weeks, making it one of the longer hiring processes in the industry. Recruiters are upfront about this timeline with candidates.\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n- Study LeetCode questions, particularly those tagged for Databricks in the past 3 months, as some questions come directly from this pool. You\u2019ll get LeetCode medium and hard level questions.\n- Brush up on concurrency and multithreading concepts, which are essential for one of the coding rounds.\n- Practice system design on Google Docs, as it is sometimes used for the system design round.\n- Be prepared for graph algorithms and optimization problems, as these appear frequently in the coding rounds.\n- Have impressive references ready\u2014they're weighted heavily in the final decision process at Databricks.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nDatabricks' recruiter screen lasts about 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare.. They'll ask about your previous experience, your interest in Databricks, and go over the specific role you're applying for. At this stage, your profile (resume, referral information, location preferences) begins to be shared with engineering leads for potential team matching.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThe technical phone screen lasts about 1 hour with an engineer. You'll use CoderPad or a similar online IDE with runnable code. Expect LeetCode-style questions, typically medium to hard difficulty. One engineer we spoke with, who had just gone through the process, told us:\n\n> *The question was one of the LeetCode questions for Databricks. I was able to find it by searching for the common Databricks questions from the past 3 months.*\n\nQuestions candidates have faced include a weighted paths problem (graph optimization) and the [house robber problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/), which builds in difficulty as time permits. After the technical screen, Databricks begins preliminary level mapping. For L4/L5 roles, the interview loops remain similar.\n\n### Step3: Hiring Manager Call\n\nMost candidates, particularly for senior roles, will have a 1-hour call with a hiring manager for the role they have been mapped to initially. This interview is primarily behavioral, covering your background and experience, what you've worked on and enjoy working on, and questions you have about Databricks and the specific organization. If a hiring manager is unavailable, you might be interviewed by the Director of Engineering for the organization in question.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite Interviews\n\nAt this point, candidates interview for specific teams based on their background and interests. Onsite interview loops vary slightly depending on role (ML, frontend, backend, etc.) and seniority level, but the below is generally what you'll get:\n\n- **Coding 1: Algorithms** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad or a similar online IDE with runnable code. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/databricks-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **Coding 2:** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/databricks-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **Coding: Concurrency/Multithreading** (1 hour). This round focuses on implementing programs that leverage multithreading for efficiency. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding: Concurrency/Multithreading section below](https://interviewing.io/databricks-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **System Design** (1 hour). The system design interview is often conducted using Google Docs, which some candidates find unusual compared to whiteboarding or specialized diagramming tools. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/databricks-interview-questions#question-design).\n- **Cross-functional/Behavioral** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Cross-functional/Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/databricks-interview-questions#question-behavioral).\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Databricks\n\nDatabricks' technical questions tend to lean toward the difficult side. For coding interviews, expect LeetCode hard more than medium questions.\n\n### Coding\n\nThere are usually 3 coding rounds. Two will focus on Data Structures and Algorithms, and one might focus on concurrency and multithreading. The coding rounds that include algorithm questions are LeetCode medium or hard in terms of level. An example question we heard involved IAP to CIDR (checking if IP address ranges fit into CIDR notation). Another was a variable-sized tic-tac-toe game implementation question.\n\nCandidates report these coding rounds tend to involve tricky optimizations\u2014you can use a brute force solution to make progress, but you should be thinking of optimizations throughout.\n\nIn the Concurrency and Multithreading coding round, you might be asked to implement an efficient logger that processes messages in a queue. This round is considered particularly challenging by most candidates. One engineer we spoke to, who is familiar with the process, told us:\n\n> *This question wasn\u2019t on LeetCode, but preparing by solving the LeetCode questions on concurrency and multithreading will be a huge help.*\n\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in Databricks interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Databricks engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Binary Search](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n[Sorting](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=sorting)\n\n### System Design\n\nTheir system design questions are pretty standard, but they will expand on the initial question to dig deeper into your depth of knowledge. One example we heard involved designing a service that provides customers with the cheapest copy of a book they're searching for, which requires considering integration with different book distributors, search functionality, and purchase flows.\n\nBe prepared to use Google Docs for these interviews rather than whiteboarding tools, which some candidates found unusual. This choice seems to be up to the individual interviewer, so don\u2019t be caught off guard!\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Cross-Functional/Behavioral\n\nThis interview is with the hiring manager and includes standard behavioral questions about your past experiences and projects. The recruiter may brief you on the hiring manager's style beforehand. You\u2019ll be asked about your past projects and explore areas of conflict resolution and teamwork. Expect questions like \"Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a coworker\" and \"Describe a project you're most proud of,\" with deep follow-up questions on specifics.\n\n### How HubSpot Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nAfter the onsite interviews, Databricks has a thorough evaluation process that consists of multiple layers of review.\n\nReference checks are an important part of the evaluation, typically involving 1 manager and 2 more senior team members. Databricks emphasizes having impressive references, as they're weighted heavily in the final decision.\n\nNext comes the Hiring Committee review. Unlike the interview panel, this is a separate committee that reviews all aspects of your candidacy: interview feedback, background, career trajectory, and references. Our sources emphasize that the final decision is holistic, so having every aspect of your application as strong as possible is crucial.\n\nFinally, the VP of Engineering reviews the complete candidate packet and has the final say on hiring decisions. One of our sources reported failing at this step despite positive feedback in earlier rounds, suggesting that the bar remains high throughout the entire process.\n\nIn some cases, candidates might be asked to complete an additional take-home assessment after the onsite. While this is rare, it might be used when the recruiter believes it could strengthen a candidate's application. These assessments can take around 5 hours to complete and may involve specialized problems such as database challenges.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

You\u2019ll be interviewed by people from different teams during the interview loop.\n\nThe entire process takes about 6 weeks, and we\u2019ve heard it can seem quite slow at times. You might have to push to speed things up.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nDatadog\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll ask you about your previous experience, why you\u2019re interested in Datadog, and what you\u2019re looking for moving forward.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies.

You will get two questions in this interview.\nWe will cover what we know of their question style in the section called [\u201cTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Datadog\u201d below](https://interviewing.io/datadog-interview-questions#question-types).\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nOnsite interview loops can vary slightly depending on the role and seniority, but the below is generally what you\u2019ll get.\n\n- **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/datadog-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **[Only for roles below Staff] Second coding** (1 hour). As above.\n- **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in your choice of tool (many candidates choose Excalidraw). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/datadog-interview-questions#question-design).\n- **Behavioral** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted by a hiring manager or director of engineering. It may feature some technical questions! For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/datadog-interview-questions#question-behavioral) .\n- **[For Staff level roles and above] Presentation** (1 hour). This will replace one of the coding rounds. You will be asked to present a project you\u2019ve worked on in the past to a panel. You\u2019ll be expected to justify the technical decisions involved and explain the business context or rationale for what you did. If you do this interview, you may have to pick teams you're interested in beforehand so people from those teams can attend.\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Datadog\n\n### Coding\n\nFrom the first technical phone screen through to the onsite coding rounds, you should expect algorithmic questions but likely NOT questions taken verbatim from LeetCode \u2013 Datadog has their own internal question bank. We\u2019ve heard that the questions are a hybrid between practical and LeetCode-style. They might start with something similar to what you can find on LeetCode but then layer on additional complexity. Datadog themselves recommend practicing medium-level LeetCode questions. You might be asked questions like these:\n\n- Bucketing numbers given specific requirements\n- Given a root directory, find the total size of all the files across all sub-directories\n- Given an interface and a file class, build a buffered file writer\n\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in Datadog interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Datadog engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Binary Trees](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Matrices](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Sets](/sets-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/sets-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=sets)\n\n[Binary Search](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n### System Design\n\nWe\u2019ve heard that this round is less broad than it can be at other companies. You won\u2019t be asked to \u201cDesign Twitter\u201d, for example. Instead, you might get a question such as, \u201cGiven a service that returns flight deals for the last 7 days, design a system that surfaces relevant flight data to a user and notifies the user when there\u2019s a new flight that matches their criteria.\u201d\n\nAs one of our users said:\n\n> *\"[I] didn\u2019t have to go into detail in every area. They kept it very high level, and the interview felt fair.\u201d*\n\nWhile it might be a fair interview, it\u2019s also used for leveling so make sure to brush up on system design. We\u2019ve heard of candidates being down-leveled for less-than-flawless performance here.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis interview will be with someone in a leadership role at the company, possibly a director. It will contain some standard behavioral questions but also some technical questions about your past work.\n\nYou might be asked to show a simple design of something you built at a previous company. The interviewer will want to know why certain design choices were made so they can understand your impact on the project and your level of experience working within teams.\n\n### How Datadog Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nAfter a successful onsite, a Hiring Committee will decide if you should be hired.\n\nIf they want to make an offer, your profile will be shared with multiple hiring managers for team matching. You\u2019ll get a chance to meet a few people from the team including the hiring manager. This is more about you figuring out a good fit than being a continuation of the interview process.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Along with behavioral, it\u2019s what determines your level, and the bar is high.\n\n![Recruiter call, Hiring Manager screen, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Door_Dash_Interview_Process_64864553b9.png)\n\nAt DoorDash, the process has recently moved from centralized to decentralized. This means that the interview process will vary from team to team somewhat. You apply and interview for a specific role, and the hiring manager for that role will be part of your loop. You can interview for up to 3 roles at a time and will encounter interviewers from across the organization in most scenarios.\n\nThe entire process takes about 3-4 weeks but can be completed in as little as 2 weeks, according to our sources.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nDoorDash\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll ask you about your previous experience, why you\u2019re interested in DoorDash, your understanding of DoorDash\u2019s value proposition, and what you\u2019re looking for moving forward. They\u2019ll also review the specific role you\u2019re applying for to make sure your skill set matches the requirements. After this call, the recruiter will circulate your resume and specific hiring managers will have the opportunity to pick it up and request to interview you.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Hiring Manager Screen\n\nThis interview will be with the hiring manager for the team you applied to. They will ask you to do a deep dive into a previous project.\n\n### Step 3: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThis is a pretty standard technical screen and normally gets conducted in CodePair (HackerRank). Our sources tell us that LeetCode medium questions are pretty typical in this round.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nAt this point, candidates are split into different loops depending on the role they are interviewing for, e.g., infrastructure, frontend, backend etc. Onsite interview loops vary slightly depending on the role and seniority, but the below is generally what you\u2019ll get:\n\n- **Two coding rounds** (1 hour each). These rounds usually take place in CodePair (HackerRank). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/doordash-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **System design** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/doordash-interview-questions#question-design).\n- **Behavioral** (1 hour). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/doordash-interview-questions#question-behavioral).\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at DoorDash\n\nDoorDash has shifted its process from a centralized one to a decentralized one pretty recently, so there is some variation in terms of the style of question you will encounter. That said, the engineers we\u2019ve spoken to say it\u2019s still pretty standard fare across the board, so practicing medium-level LeetCode questions will help.\n\n### Coding\n\nThis interview will be less algorithms and data structures heavy and will look to test your ability to write code fast and refactor quickly. You won\u2019t be asked to use any specific programming language. Most questions should be practical in nature, and LeetCode questions that focus on job scheduling are popular.\n\nFrom one of our users, who was a DoorDash interviewer:\n\n> *Some questions are very practical, but it depends on the interviewer. Some love very specific LeetCode-style graph questions.*\n\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in DoorDash interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former DoorDash engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Trees](/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=trees)\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Linked Lists](/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=linked-lists)\n\n[Matrices](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n### System Design\n\nThis round focuses mostly on large systems and will involve designing an entire service or app with scalability, reliability, and usability concerns in mind. Expect a vague problem with ill-defined boundaries. Your focus should be on not getting lost in one area. Ask your interviewer what area you should hone in on.\n\nThey use this round for leveling, and senior candidates should be able to call out all requirements and considerations. They aren\u2019t looking for a full solution here, so don\u2019t get lost in the details. Cover all bases and concerns.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis round varies by role but is usually with the hiring manager for your team. It is a behavioral interview, but the hiring manager will also try to close you. You could pass all the other rounds and not do well here but still get an offer. Expect to answer questions about past experiences.\n\n### How DoorDash Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nThe entire onsite panel submits written feedback after the interviews are completed, and then they have a roundtable meeting to discuss both hire/no-hire and leveling. Most of the time, decisions are reached by consensus (everyone agrees to hire or no-hire), but in cases where consensus isn\u2019t possible, the hiring manager has final say. Our sources say that it is rare for a hiring manager to veto a hire.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

This is an executive screen, which is essentially a behavioral interview with the director of the team you are interviewing for.\n\n![Figma\u2019s interview process: Recruiter call, Hiring manager call, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Figma_s_Company_Process_df7aa4a2c0.png)\n\nFigma\u2019s hiring process is a hybrid. Although you apply for a specific team from the get-go, your interviews will likely not be with the people on your team \u2013 interviewers are randomly selected from a pool \u2013 except for the hiring manager interview and the executive screening (if applicable).\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n- You\u2019ll get [a guide to Figma\u2019s hiring process](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4tdq51dnc2ykp347vmphy/Public-General-Candidate-Prep-Doc.pdf?rlkey=mfucvg5hiava8x2xpuz24tiwh&e=4&dl=0) that includes a lot of useful information\n- Their interview process is language-agnostic\n- Brush up on general algorithms and data structures, but be prepared for them to use Figma terminology when they pose the questions\n- They say you can only apply to one role at a time, so pick wisely\n- Try to get a referral; it\u2019s hard to get into the process otherwise\n- Learn as much as you can about Figma\u2019s architecture\n- Express why you like the product and why you want to join\u2013they are on the path to IPO and getting a lot of high-quality applicants\n\nThe entire process takes about 3-4 weeks, but we heard they can move faster if needed.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nFigma\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll ask you about your previous experience, why you\u2019re interested in Figma, your understanding of Figma\u2019s value proposition, and what you\u2019re looking for moving forward.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Hiring Manager Call\n\nThis is a pretty standard behavioral call with the hiring manager of the team you are interviewing for. Expect some questions about your background and experience but also some information about the team and what they are working on. You\u2019ll get time to ask your own questions too.\n\n### Step 3: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThis interview is scheduled as a block with the hiring manager call above and will be conducted in CoderPad. The questions will be algorithmic, but they will be set in a Figma context. In other words, they might pose a problem they run into at Figma and ask how you\u2019d solve it with code, or ask you a very standard algorithmic question, but layer in some Figma terminology. It\u2019s a good idea to brush up on Figma\u2019s names for the various components they use. [You can find information here](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-components-in-Figma). Expect about a medium in terms of LeetCode-level.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nAt this point, candidates split into different loops depending on the role they are interviewing for e.g., ML, frontend, backend etc. Onsite interview loops also vary slightly depending on the role and seniority, but the below is generally what you\u2019ll get:\n\n- **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/figma-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in Figma. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/figma-interview-questions#question-design).\n- **Second system design** (1 hour) This interview will be conducted in Figma. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/figma-interview-questions#question-design).\n- **Behavioral** (1 hour). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/figma-interview-questions#question-behavioral).\n- **Project deep dive** (1 hour) For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Project Deep Dive section below](https://interviewing.io/figma-interview-questions#question-deep-dive).\n\n### [Staff-level or Close to It] Step 5: Executive Screen\n\nIf you\u2019re interviewing for a Staff level role, or quite senior and on the cusp of Staff, they will do one more round after the onsite. It is a behavioral round with a Director. They might tell you this is a casual chat, but one engineer said:\n\n> *The Director clearly used all the feedback given during the onsite and intentionally drilled into areas that were outside of what I\u2019d covered before. This was very intense!*\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Figma\n\n### Coding\n\nThis will likely be algorithms and data structures-focused but will skew more practical than typical LeetCode questions. Expect about a LeetCode-medium level of difficulty. An engineer we spoke called described them as\n\n> *Pretty standard algorithms and data structures questions, but they are all Figma-flavored.*\n\nSample questions include:\n\n- Implement a Figma doc with layers, properties, class definitions, and ways to update\n- Print out objects on a 2D canvas in a sequential order, left to right and top to bottom\n\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in Figma interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Figma engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Binary Search](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Stacks](/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1   \n interview replay](/mocks?technical=stacks)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n### System Design\n\nYou will get two system design rounds:\n\n1. Relating to [Figma components](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-components-in-Figma) and how to design a feature around them\n2. Another that is more focused on your specific role\n\nThey will send you a public guide to Figma components to help with the first system design round, so brush up on that. Components are like classes in Figma. The second round will lean more towards the type of work you will be doing, e.g., back-end or front-end.\n\nAs with the coding interviews, expect something practical here. It will very likely be related to an issue that Figma has encountered before. You might be asked to design a poll system within Figma that can handle multiple concurrent users. Expect to be asked about scaling and storage options.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis interview will be conducted by a hiring manager from within the same organization but not the team you are interviewing for. It\u2019s going to be pretty standard, with questions about:\n\n- How you\u2019ve handled feedback in the past\n- How you approach conflict\n- Past projects you\u2019re proud of\n\n### Project Deep Dive\n\nFor this interview, you\u2019ll be asked to prepare a few slides on a previous technical project you\u2019ve worked on. It\u2019s a pretty interactive session where they\u2019ll dig into:\n\n- The scale and scope of your role on the project\n- The technical details of the project\n- What issues you ran into\n- What tradeoffs were made\n- What you\u2019d do differently\n\nUnlike some project deep dives we\u2019ve come across, this will likely be with only one interviewer.\n\n### Executive Screen\n\nAll we can say is that this is a behavioral round. It\u2019s hard to say what the Director will ask during this session, but they will be looking for any areas left unturned during the onsite and drilling into them.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

[Learning Center](https://interviewing.io/learn) \n2.   [Guides](https://interviewing.io/learn#interview-guides) \n3.   Amazon's interview process and questions \n\nAll human organizations operate as a metaphor. Amazon isn\u2019t a sports team or a family; they\u2019re a motley crew of Terminators. They\u2019re a different breed with notoriously high standards. They reward aggression. And they want to take over the market (or the earth, depending on who you ask)...\n\nAmazon\u2019s process is not centralized, and you can interview with multiple teams concurrently. To up your odds, interview with as many teams as you have the appetite for.\n\nAmazon really loves their [Leadership Principles (LPs)](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles). Amazon interviewers may sandwich LP questions anywhere and everywhere throughout your interview rounds: coding rounds, system design rounds, all rounds. In short, at an Amazon interview, be prepared for Leadership Principles questions anywhere, anytime.\n\nFinally, Amazon has one of the more-structured interviewing cultures. They\u2019re the only FAANG where interviewers exist in a formal hierarchy, and Amazon openly encourages and rewards interviewers who reach the top rung in that hierarchy.\n\nIn this guide we\u2019ve compiled a comprehensive Amazon job interview prep guide based on in-depth discussions with Amazon interviewers and interviewees. Our guide includes a detailed walkthrough of the interview process, common questions and solutions, interview tips, video replays of mock Amazon interviews, and more.\n\nAn overview of Amazon's interview process and questions\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nAmazon\u2019s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Recruiter call OR online assessment\n*   Technical phone screen (if you didn\u2019t do the online assessment)\n*   Onsite\n\nWe walk through each of these steps in detail below.\n\n![Image 1: Amazon\u2019s interview process: online assessment or recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Famazon-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Step 1: Online assessment or recruiter call\n\nWhether you start with an online assessment or an Amazon recruiter call depends on a few factors:\n\n*   Are you a mid-to-senior engineer?\n*   Have you previously interviewed at Amazon?\n*   Have you previously worked at a FAANG?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, then you will likely not have to do an online assessment, and your first step will be a recruiter call. That said, we\u2019ve gotten some conflicting reports from Amazonians, and it may be that Amazon has more recently started using online assessments to test the competencies of more senior engineers as well.\n\nIf you do the online assessment, here\u2019s how it works. It\u2019s a timed, asynchronous test consisting of several coding problems, conducted via [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). These are usually data structures and algorithm problems of easy to medium-level difficulty, as well as some multiple choice system design questions where you have to select the design option that\u2019s ideal in a given situation. If you do well in the online assessment, you can skip the second step, which is the technical phone screen.\n\nIf you end up skipping the online assessment, the first step in your process will be a recruiter call. Please see the section above called [\u201cA note about recruiter calls.\u201d](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone screen\n\nAmazon\u2019s technical phone interview is a coding interview that tends to focus exclusively on data structures and algorithms. Despite the focus on speed, [Amazon interview questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon) may require a lot of code, and the time allowed is usually 30-40 minutes, which means you\u2019ll usually get one question, as opposed to Facebook, where you might get multiple questions.\n\nFor these screens, Amazon uses an internal tool called Livecode, which has syntax highlighting for popular languages but does NOT have the ability to run the code. In fact, no code is ever compiled or run in Amazon technical interviews.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s a 50% chance that your interviewer will throw in 1 or 2 Leadership Principles questions into the phone screen. They\u2019re not guaranteed, but they\u2019ll definitely come up during the onsite.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite interviews\n\nThere\u2019s some variance, but the typical Amazon onsite, or in-person interview, for technical roles, will consist of:\n\n*   At least one behavioral round (this doesn\u2019t include all the Leadership Principles questions peppered through the other interviews)\n*   Three coding rounds \n*   One system design round \n*   One hiring manager round\n\nAmazon has a special type of interviewer that they include in onsite loops: the Bar Raiser. These are typically senior-level Amazon employees at the top of the formal interviewer hierarchy, and they\u2019re the toughest and most-trained interviewers at Amazon. They serve as an independent and objective evaluator, asking follow-up questions, and ensuring that hiring decisions are not influenced solely by the candidate's immediate team or department.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Bar Raiser at Amazon\n\n\u201cBeing a Bar Raiser makes an impact on your promotion packet. Every L5 nearing promotion at Amazon, is encouraged to do the Bar Raiser training. It\u2019s a big input to get to L6 or L7. Part of the promotion packet is: how are you demonstrating some of the Leadership Principles. And \u201cHire and Develop the Best\u201d is one of the LPs. There\u2019s a lot of work to do in hiring to become a Bar Raiser: you have to do a lot of training and a ton of interviews. Being a Bar Raiser carries a lot of weight at Amazon if you want to get promoted.\u201d\n\nAt Amazon, Bar Raisers and hiring managers are the only interviewers who have the formal authority to veto a hiring decision. You can recognize them because they are the only interviewer in your onsite loop who has nothing to do with the team you\u2019re interviewing for. Bar Raiser rounds can be super intense, but don\u2019t shrink when you feel a Bar Raiser throw flames your way; embrace the fire.\n\nThe three types of Amazon interview\n-----------------------------------\n\nThere are three main types of interviews you\u2019ll face as a software engineer interviewing at Amazon. These are coding, behavioral, and system design interviews.\n\n### 1. Coding interview\n\nYou will have to do coding interviews in the phone screen and in the onsite. Coding rounds at the onsite are very similar to technical phone screen rounds, except that in the technical phone screen you _might_ get Leadership Principles questions, whereas in the onsite coding portion, you definitely _will_.\n\nAmazon asks mostly medium-difficulty LeetCode-style coding questions and avoids hard questions. The idea is to let candidates demonstrate how quickly they get to the optimal result, all in the service of hiring engineers who can churn out new features quickly.\n\nDespite the focus on speed, Amazon questions may be a complex problem that requires a lot of code, and the time allowed is usually 30-40 minutes, which means you\u2019ll usually get one question, as opposed to Facebook, where you might get multiple questions.\n\nAmazon\u2019s coding rounds test the following technical skills:\n\n1.   Computer science fundamentals and knowledge of data structures and algorithms\n2.   The ability to write logical and maintainable code. These rounds require writing some classes and implementing some functions, e.g., \u201cImplement some common functions of a file system\u201d\n\nAlthough your performance in technical interviews matters (if you fail the technical, you usually will not move forward), it\u2019s not as important as the outcome of the behavioral interview, and coding interviews during the onsite at Amazon actually feature Leadership Principles questions.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Amazon Interviewer\n\n\u201cBecause no code is ever run on an editor, the approach, speed, and testing are most important. Code syntax, typos, variable naming, and edge cases are less important.\u201d\n\nGraph questions are among the most popular types of questions asked at Amazon, as well as tree questions that require BFS or DFS. Classic questions like LRU cache, meeting rooms, word break, word search, word ladder, and so on may also come up.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard from Amazon interviewers that _all_ of the data structures and algorithms questions in Amazon\u2019s official question bank are actually on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-amazon-questions/). That said, Amazon interviewers are allowed to ask whatever they want in coding rounds, and some will deviate from the question bank to ask more practical questions such as, \u201cImplement a function with some behavior with the help of these two APIs\u2026\u201d\u201d\n\nFinally, like Facebook, Amazon shies away from dynamic programming questions (though they\u2019re not banned outright).\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Amazon\u2019s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Amazon coding interview preparation resources](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon#amazon-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### 2. Behavioral interview\n\nThe behavioral interview is one of, along with coding interviews at the onsite, the most important in terms of leading to an offer.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Bar Raiser at Amazon\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done over a hundred interviews at Amazon. The behavioral interview is most likely to get someone pushed over the line if they were borderline in their technical interviews. The opposite is not true: if they don\u2019t meet the behavioral bar, we don\u2019t care how they did in technicals, we aren\u2019t hiring them.\u201d\n\nBehavioral is an extremely important part of the Amazon interview process \u2013 Amazon is more likely to downlevel or reject you solely based on behavioral \u2013 and their behavioral round might be the most well-thought-out interview in all of big tech. It also might be the easiest to fail if you don\u2019t specifically prepare for it. There\u2019s no flavor like the flavor of an Amazonian behavioral interviewer; if you\u2019ve never encountered it before and don\u2019t expect it, it can be jarring.\n\nOne of the most common mistakes our users make is not taking this interview seriously because at most other companies, behavioral interviews tend to be more lip service than a meaningful part of the process. The bottom line is, if you want an Amazon job at a senior level or above, you have to seriously prepare for the behavioral interview questions.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nNot all Leadership Principles are created equal. Customer Obsession is the \ud83d\udc51one Leadership Principle to rule them all. When in doubt, demonstrate Customer Obsession. If you get a curveball, give an answer that shows you\u2019re deeply committed to making things customers love.\n\n#### Anecdote from Amazon Bar Raiser\n\n\u201cIf you have a bad LP round, or if LPs are problematic in the debrief, it\u2019s almost always a \u2018no hire.\u2019 But if you have great LPs then there is a conversation where we try to see if the candidate can be hired even if the technical rounds weren't at the bar. But not the other way around. But if there\u2019s anything \u2018at the bar\u2019 or \u2018below the bar\u2019 for LP, then you fail.\u201d\n\n#### Anecdote from Amazon Bar Raiser\n\n\u201cIf a candidate does not do that well on the technical round but they do well on LPs, there is always a possibility of recycling the candidate because they\u2019re a good fit for Amazon but not good for the team. So sometimes we\u2019ll help them interview with other teams, and they don\u2019t have to do a full onsite: they just need to do 1-2 more rounds as a follow up. But if they\u2019re below the bar for LPs, then they\u2019re not a fit for Amazon so Amazon wouldn\u2019t help set them up to other teams with shortened onsites.\u201d\n\nIn this round, expect questions from all 5 of these categories:\n\n1.   Technical problem solving\n2.   Learning (and failure)\n3.   Getting stuff (for the business) done\n4.   Interpersonal conflict\n5.   Ambiguity\n\nHonestly, the best place to find a detailed question list for Amazon\u2019s behavioral interview, as well as a bunch of other interview preparation resources, is our [Senior Engineer's Guide to the Amazon Leadership Principles Interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles).\n\n### 3. System design interview\n\nSystem design and coding aren\u2019t the be-all and end-all at Amazon \u2013 of course, you still have to pass them, but if your performance is borderline, doing well on behavioral Leadership Principles questions will take you over the finish line. In fact, interviewers will likely ask you 1-2 Leadership Principles questions in your system design interviews. Try to be efficient when answering LP questions in system design rounds. LPs come first. Finish them early so that you have more time for the technical question.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Amazon Interviewer\n\n\u201cIn many debriefs, I hear the hiring manager say that we can extend the L5 offer with the understanding that system design is not their strength, but it's coachable. At the L6 level, the system design bar is comparable to Facebook or Google.\u201d\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you\u2019re in a system design round at Amazon, and you don\u2019t know what to talk about, talk about performance. They want Amazon to be the number one customer of AWS. And they love to find engineers who understand and are passionate about fine tuning performance in the cloud.\n\nAmazon is more likely to ask you practical system design questions. For example, if you\u2019re interviewing with a team who controls Amazon\u2019s inventory management, they might ask you to design a piece of an inventory management system.\n\nOther common system design questions include:\n\n*   Design autocomplete\n*   Design file upload/download to the cloud\n*   Design search\n\nThe design questions are most likely about designing well-known features, as opposed to a complete system from scratch like Design Facebook or Twitter.\n\nAmazon interviewers are allowed to ask whatever they want in system design, but a lot of interviewers fall back on reusing questions from Amazon\u2019s question bank.\n\nFor tooling in system design interviews, candidates can usually choose any type of drawing tool. [Excalidraw](https://app.excalidraw.com/) is most popular, followed by [Miro](https://miro.com/).\n\nHow Amazon makes hiring decisions\n---------------------------------\n\nAmazon has one of the more well-structured decision-making processes in tech: teams typically do a pre-brief (live meeting before the onsite), submit asynchronous feedback, and also do a debrief (live meeting after the onsite). They rely heavily on live discussion to make decisions. Notably, though some interviewers might be able to tell an outlier story of a time a regular interviewer out-argued a Bar Raiser, most of the time the interviewers go along with what the Bar Raiser says.\n\nAmazon interviewer\u2019s grade on a 5-point scale: Strongly Inclined, Inclined, Neutral, Not Inclined, Strongly Not Inclined.\n\nThe two most important interviewers at the onsite are the Bar Raiser and the hiring manager. At Amazon, all of the other team members involved in the interview could vote to hire, but if the Bar Raiser _or_ the hiring manager aren\u2019t on board, that candidate is likely getting rejected.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nAt Amazon, identify the Bar Raiser (the only person whose work has nothing to do with the team for which you\u2019re interviewing) and the hiring manager (if you don\u2019t know who it is, ask the recruiter before the onsite or an interviewer if during the onsite). Most of your energy should go towards impressing these two people \u2013 since Amazon relies so heavily on live discussions to make hiring decisions, impression management is more impactful here.\n\nResources to prepare yourself for an Amazon coding interview\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe\u2019ve aggregated a bunch of useful Amazon content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Amazon interviewers, long-form solutions to common Amazon questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Amazon interviews.\n\n### Videos of mock interviews conducted by Amazon interviewers\n\nBelow are a series of mock interview replays, conducted by Amazon interviewers on our platform.

Netflix\u2019s interview process and questions \n\nNetflix\u2019s interview process and questions\n-----------------------------------------\n\nNetflix\u2019s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Recruiter call\n*   Hiring manager screen\n*   Technical phone interview\n*   A very long onsite\n\n![Image 1: Netflix\u2019s interview process: recruiter call, hiring manager screen, technical phone screen, onsite](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fnetflix-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Netflix\u2019s process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nEvery human organization views themselves as a metaphor; Netflix doesn\u2019t view themselves as a family like some other tech companies, they view themselves as a high-caliber sports team (in fact, Netflix calls their employees a \u201cdream team\u201d). They explain this metaphor themselves in their infamous culture memo.\n\nFinally, Netflix\u2019s interview process is decentralized and team-dependent. Moreover, you can interview with multiple teams at Netflix concurrently, which can help you increase your odds of securing a job offer.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [\u201cA note about recruiter calls\u201d](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Hiring manager screen\n\nThis is a 30 minute call. A former Netflix employee called this round \u201cVery chill, especially compared to the onsite.\u201d This round consists of bidirectional surface-level questions.\n\nThe hiring manager will also be selling you on Netflix. Hiring managers doing selling is business as usual, but in this case, it serves an additional purpose \u2013 because their onsite is by far the most intense, they have to sell harder upfront because the onsite is a bigger commitment for the candidates.\n\n### Step 3: Technical phone screen\n\nThe Netflix technical phone screen is a coding interview that typically lasts 45-60 minutes. There is significant inter-team variation on what these interviews cover, and the tooling you use during these interviews also varies by team,\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nOnsite interview structure varies from team to team, but you\u2019ll have roughly 8 interviews focused primarily on system design, then behavioral, and then coding.\n\nDepending on the length of the onsite, Netflix recruiting may ask you if you\u2019d prefer to split the onsite over two days, and we recommend that you proactively ask to do that, given how taxing the behavioral and system design portions are!\n\nNetflix is the only FAANG that routinely includes 1-2 directors in their onsite loops. If your loop has two, it\u2019ll be one director will be from your org and another from a partner org. Netflix does this to reduce bias. One director may do a system design interview, and the other will do a behavioral interview.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be thrown off by having to talk to directors. Just stick to the principles: when you speak about technical stuff you\u2019ve worked on, focus on scale, availability, and security. When you speak about behavioral stuff: use shared ideas from their culture deck, take accountability for your wins and failures, and demonstrate metrics and impact.\u201d\n\n#### Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer\n\n\u201cThe HRBP [which is basically a very senior recruiting function] and the director would typically focus on behavioral rounds. I have also seen directors spending time (30 mins) just letting candidates ask and clarify any questions that they might have regarding the team, Netflix culture, career growth path or any other aspects. So, a strong recommendation would be to be ready with your genuine questions list and get things clarified in such interviews. Candid conversation is one of the key values at Netflix and asking genuine concerns if any is seen through good lenses, as that establishes candidates' seriousness about the role to some extent.\u201d\n\nNetflix\u2019s interview types in detail\n-----------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nThe technical questions Netflix asks vary from team to team. Some teams don\u2019t ask LeetCode questions. Other teams will ask medium-difficulty LeetCode-style coding questions with a creative/practical twist.\n\nThese rounds are going to change team by team, but the pattern we\u2019ve noticed is that Netflix coding questions often come in two parts.\n\nTypically there is one question and, in scenarios where edge cases and tests are done early, say within 45 minutes, the interviewer may choose to spend some time discussing general large scale engineering concepts and distributed systems (like microservices, scalability, etc.). For instance, some expansions could be:\n\n*   A system design expansion on top of the coding question, such as a practical application where they ask you to apply the solution you just found to a part of their real-life system\n*   A deep dive into a specific skill set (e.g., if this team codes in Java: they\u2019ll have a round all about multithreading for Java specifically) \n*   For everything you need to prepare for Netflix\u2019s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Netflix coding interview preparation resources](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/netflix#netflix-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design\n\nThis is the most important round at Netflix. Coding carries the least weight, behavioral carries a lot, and system design has the most.\n\nNetflix system design rounds are highly unique and highly challenging. Netflix is to system design as Google is to coding; these technical interview rounds include the most difficult and bespoke questions.\n\nSimilar to how Amazon loves Leadership Principles, Netflix loves system design so much they even throw it into coding rounds sometimes \u2013 first, you solve a LeetCode-style problem. Then they ask you to apply it to a real-world use case.\n\nThat said, Netflix system design rounds are easier to prepare for if you know the patterns: Netflix loves scale. Netflix never wants to go down, and Netflix hates when things aren\u2019t secure. Availability is super important to them; they want to ask and hear about tactics to scale systems, keep systems highly available, and maintain secure systems.\n\nAt Netflix, you\u2019re likely to see unique questions that you won\u2019t get anywhere else, and the system design round is the part of the process that Netflix interviewers take the most pride in, so they make up hard, one-of-a-kind questions from scratch. Thematically, their questions are more likely to be focused on scaling. They also like to ask about security and availability.\n\nIn fact, Netflix is more likely than the rest of FAANG to give you a system design round focused solely on security. For instance, you might get asked what you would do during a DDoS attack, and the entirety of the session will be spent drilling down into the details. And because they\u2019re also obsessed with availability, you might get questions around backups and what to do if a service goes down.\n\nMoreover, as with their coding rounds, Netflix prefers questions with a practical application, and they\u2019re likely to ask you about something they\u2019re working on right now. If you research the hell out of their architecture \u2013 specifically the service that particular team is in charge of \u2013 and the other services this service interacts with, you\u2019ll be in good shape.\n\nYou\u2019re also likely to see a \u201creverse system design\u201d round, where your interviewer will ask you pointed questions about the systems you\u2019ve worked on before, e.g., the largest scale system you\u2019ve worked on, how did you manage it, how did you scale it, etc.\n\nQuestions they most likely _won\u2019t_ ask are product-focused questions, such as \u201cDesign Spotify\u201d.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nLearn about Netflix\u2019s overall architecture so you can a) speak their language, and b) build or speak of something similar (in the interview) that Netflix has already built but simpler.\n\nFor the team you interview with: what\u2019s their tech stack? What open source stuff do they do? With which other services might their service interact? That last question is most critical. If you can put forethought into how their current system works, you\u2019ll have a huge leg up; then all you\u2019ll need to do is discuss what you learned about their system to score a bunch of points with any of their interviewers.\n\nWhat tooling you use in these interviews depends on the team you\u2019re interviewing with.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nAnswers to behavioral questions are almost as important as system design at Netflix. You\u2019ll get rejected if you fail the behavioral screen.\n\nThese interviews have a heavy emphasis on the candidate being a cultural fit, being able to work in a team, having curiosity, and being product minded, highly motivated individuals capable of driving products forward.\n\nA unique part of Netflix\u2019s behavioral interview is the \u201cDream Team\u201d interview. This is a slightly more intense behavioral round conducted by a director. The \"volume\" is turned up on all of the things you might see in a typical behavioral round at Netflix (scale, accountability, open communication about concerns, high risk and high reward.)\n\n#### Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer\n\n\u201cNetflix doesn\u2019t hire as much as other FAANGs, so they want to make sure you're a star. That\u2019s what the \u2018Dream Team\u2019 interview is about.\u201d\n\nOne key thing you need to do before your Netflix behavioral interview is read their culture memo. Our interviewers tell us that if you don\u2019t do this, you will fail the behavioral round.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Netflix Engineer\n\n\u201cThe culture illustrated in the [culture memo](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture) is sort of accurate to how the culture at Netflix actually is, but the actual culture is less intense. Team members tend to get along really well. You don\u2019t compete with others in your performance review like it is at companies like Facebook. We\u2019re not ranked against peers, so people are more willing to help each other out.\u201d\n\nNetflix will ask about impressive things you\u2019ve done, as well as dig into your motivation (your \u201cwhy\u201d). This round will feel like you\u2019re doing self-promotion. Typical questions will ask about your favorite project, latest project, and most significant project, as well as open-ended questions about what you\u2019re looking for in your next role and why you\u2019re interested in Netflix.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nPromote yourself early and often in Netflix behavioral rounds. Promote yourself proactively. Metrics and impact statements are effective ways to promote yourself because they convey a sense of scale and complexity.\n\nIt can be nerve-wracking to talk to a director for 45-60 minutes. It\u2019s more nerve-wracking when, out the gate, they ask you to describe the biggest thing you\u2019ve ever worked on. When talking to a director, it\u2019s more important to have metrics and impact statements.\n\nHow Netflix makes hiring decisions\n----------------------------------\n\nNetflix interviewers are untrained, their questions are unstandardized, their interviews are team-dependent, and their decision-making north star is \u201cWhy\u201d. You can interview with multiple teams concurrently, effectively giving you multiple shots on goal.\n\nThere\u2019s also no specific company-wide scale for performance at Netflix. This is different from, say, Google, where all candidates are graded on the same \u201cStrong Hire, Hire, Neutral, No Hire, Strong No-Hire\u201d scale. Different teams have different processes, but most decisions are made based on live post-onsite discussions.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer\n\n\u201cNetflix hiring decisions are black and white: pass or fail. And then you discuss if you'd be open to changing your mind. The only difference between Apple and Netflix was how they defined cultural fit. Besides that the hiring decisions were made in the same way: informal, mainly based on live discussions, binary decisions, and striving for consensus.\u201d\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nImpression management is more powerful at companies that do live feedback discussions. To learn more about impression management, check out the resources to prepare for Netflix later in this section.\n\nNetflix coding interview preparation resources\n----------------------------------------------\n\nWe\u2019ve aggregated a bunch of useful Netflix content for you!

Help us write more guides like this one by [filling out this form!](https://iiosurveys.typeform.com/to/UVWQf8ZT) Get a free mock interview for your help.\n\nPublished: January 15, 2024\n\n## Grammarly's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Grammarly can expect the following process:\n\n- Recruiter call (30 minutes)\n- Technical phone screen (1 hour)\n- Hiring Manager screen (1 hour)\n- Onsite (5.5 hours)\n\n![Grammarly\u2019s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Hiring Manager screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Grammarly_Interview_Process_4de1973fa7.png)\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n- Having a referral guarantees a call-back (not true at many other companies).\n- Grinding on LeetCode will help because they primarily ask questions straight from LeetCode.\n- They can be slow, so don\u2019t be afraid to follow up a lot and keep reminding them you have other offer deadlines.\n- Learn their [EAGER framework of values](https://www.grammarly.com/jobs). They will want you to know these and align with them during your interviews.\n- It's a foreign-founded company, so you may encounter interviewers who aren\u2019t native English speakers and have a different cultural style than you\u2019re used to.\n\nGrammarly has a hybrid process, which means that you will interview for a specific team and role but your interview panel will be a mix of engineers from the team and from elsewhere in the company. It will also include the hiring manager for the role you are interviewing for.\n\nThe entire process takes about 6 weeks, but our sources tell us it shouldn\u2019t have to \u2013 by default, Grammarly is slow in moving things forward, but if you\u2019re proactive, you can speed up the process.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nGrammarly\u2019s recruiter call lasts about 30 minutes, and it\u2019s different from a lot of recruiter screens. Be prepared to get asked questions that require STAR-style responses. One of our sources was surprised by the style of question they got at this stage, so be prepared!\n\nIt\u2019s also really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nGrammarly\u2019s technical phone screen lasts about an hour. It will be conducted in HackerRank, and you should expect medium-difficulty LeetCode-style questions.\n\n### Step 3: Hiring Manager Screen\n\nThis is a presentation and a deep dive into a complex project that you\u2019ve worked on. For more senior roles, you\u2019ll be asked to describe a project you led.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard that you may not necessarily get clear instructions about this round, and you may not be told to prepare a presentation in advance, but we heartily recommend that you do! One of our sources did well in this round *because he already had a presentation prepared for another company and was able to seamlessly jump into it when he realized what the call was about*. Though it may not be critical to have a presentation fully prepared, doing so will give you an edge. Either way, come prepared to discuss the overall architecture (including diagrams as needed), what problem you were trying to solve, and your role in the successful completion of the project.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nWe\u2019ve heard that Grammarly\u2019s onsite is very long and can be split across multiple days.\n\n- **Product intuition/domain expertise** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CodePair (HackerRank\u2019s coding interview tool). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/grammarly-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **System design** (1 hour). This will likely be in Miro or HackerRank's whiteboarding tool. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/grammarly-interview-questions#question-design).\n- **Coding / CS fundamentals** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CodePair. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/grammarly-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **Coffee chat (virtual)** (30 minutes). You meet with two people from your future team and get to ask them questions.\n- **Values call 1** (1 hour) This interview will be with someone from Grammarly who isn\u2019t from the org or team you are applying to. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Values section below](https://interviewing.io/grammarly-interview-questions#question-values) .\n- **Values call 2** (1 hour) This interview will be conducted by a hiring manager. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Values section below](https://interviewing.io/grammarly-interview-questions#question-values) .\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Grammarly\n\nFrom what we\u2019ve heard, Grammarly doesn\u2019t ask practical questions. They do have a standard bank of questions they regularly ask, and LeetCode-style questions are common.\n\n### Product Intuition / Domain Expertise\n\nThis might be a two-part question and varies by role. In the first part, you could be shown an email with the Grammarly tool engaged and certain words or phrases highlighted. Your job will be to improve the product.\n\nThe second part will involve a standard LeetCode-style question.\n\n### Coding\n\nExpect another two-part interview here with standard LeetCode-style questions in the first part.\n\nThe second part might be a lot more academic. One source told us:\n\n> *\"The second problem looked like it came straight out of an algorithms textbook.\u201d*\n\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in Grammarly interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Grammarly engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Binary Trees](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Parsing](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1   \n interview replay](/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Recursion](/recursion-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/recursion-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=recursion)\n\n[Two Pointers](/two-pointers-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/two-pointers-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 3   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=two-pointers)\n\n[Heaps](/heaps-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/heaps-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=heaps)\n\n### System Design\n\nThis will likely be a two-part question where you\u2019re asked to design something at a small scale in the first part and then asked to scale it up in the second. Time management is critical here because they will ask lots of questions during the first part. We\u2019ve heard that this is a tough interview, but that you can do poorly, and potentially get a chance to redo it after the onsite.\n\nAreas to focus on are:\n\n- Client-server communication\n- Separation of concerns\n- Data structures and flows\n- A system\u2019s extensibility and scaling\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Values\n\nYou will have two calls that focus on Values, one with a hiring manager and the other with someone from a completely different part of the company. One of the people we interviewed for this guide was interviewed by someone from the Social Media team.\n\nBoth calls will ask questions about your past work experience. They will use your resume and frame their questions around your past companies. Be prepared to use their [EAGER framework](https://www.grammarly.com/about) of values, and show that you understand and embody the values they are looking for. EAGER stands for Ethical, Adaptable, Gritty, Empathetic, and Remarkable. Look for ways to show that you embody these values as you go through your interviews, even the technical ones.\n\nExpect to go through each company you\u2019ve worked from and answer questions like:\n\n- What would your manager say your strengths were?\n- What would your manager say your weaknesses were?\n- What would you say your manager's strengths were?\n- What would you say your manager's weaknesses were?\n\n### How Grammarly Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nThe entire onsite panel submits written feedback after the interviews are completed and then meets to discuss. Most of the time, decisions are reached by consensus (everyone agrees to hire or no-hire), but in cases where consensus isn\u2019t possible, the hiring manager has the final say.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Help us write more guides like this one by [filling out this form!](https://iiosurveys.typeform.com/to/UVWQf8ZT) Get a free mock interview for your help.\n\nPublished: November 26, 2024\n\n## HubSpot's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 2-4 Steps\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at HubSpot can expect the following process:\n\n- Recruiter call (30 minutes)\n- Asynchronous coding challenge (3 hour)\n- Onsite (4 hours)\n\n![HubSpot\u2019s interview process: Recruiter call, Asynchronous coding challenge, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Hub_Spot_s_Interview_Process_c6178a59fd.png)\n\nHubspot\u2019s hiring process is a hybrid. Although you apply for a specific team from the get-go, your interviews will likely not be with the people on your team \u2013 interviewers are randomly selected from a pool \u2013 except for the hiring manager interview.\n\nHubspot is one of the few companies that will actually give you some constructive post-interview feedback!\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n- LeetCode practice is helpful, as their coding questions are all in that style.\n- During the coding rounds, it is important to find edge cases.\n- You might read that they are very focused on the behavioral round and your ability to match up to their values, but in practice we\u2019ve heard their behavioral round is pretty standard. That said, the interviewers will talk about the culture so it\u2019s best to come prepared with questions about their values.\n- They use Java, but the interview process is language-agnostic.\n- You must convince the interviewer you are familiar with the technologies you mention in a system design interview. You need to know more than buzzwords.\n- They know that most of their questions are found online, so they look for you to go deeper.\n- You\u2019ll get detailed feedback from the recruiter after the technical onsite rounds. This can be given verbally or via email and will happen before the behavioral round.\n\nThe hiring process takes about 2-4 weeks, and we\u2019ve heard that their interviewers are pretty friendly and collaborative compared to FAANG companies. They are also competitive with FAANG salaries.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nHubSpot\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll ask you about your previous experience, why you\u2019re interested in HubSpot, and what you\u2019re looking for moving forward. They will discuss salary ranges, and we\u2019ve heard they are competitive with Meta and Google.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Asynchronous Coding Challenge\n\nIn this challenge, you\u2019ll get API access. You\u2019ll need to make a call to the API, process data, and POST back a response/solution. If the solution is correct, you\u2019ll get a 200 status code, which means you\u2019ve completed the exercise.\n\nYou can use any language for this assignment, and it starts as soon as you click the link in the email they will send you. You have three hours to complete the assignment, i.e., make the request to the API. After that, you\u2019ll need to submit the code in a zip file, but that doesn\u2019t need to happen within the three hour window, so you\u2019ll have time to clean up your code afterward.\n\nOne engineer we spoke to said:\n\n> *I don\u2019t think they even review the code, you just need to get 200, and that\u2019s good enough to pass.*\n\nAnother engineer we spoke to described the problem as follows:\n\n> *Overall, the pattern is going to be a sorting/aggregating approach to a JSON array, where you have some field like \u201ctimestamp\u201d, and some other field that might be an enum, and you will be posting it back to the API provided*\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThis will vary slightly between Senior SWE 1 and Senior SWE 2 but only during the second system design round. **You have to pass each round before moving on to the next.**\n\n- **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad, but we have heard you can use your own IDE too. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/hubspot-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in the drawing tool of your choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/hubspot-interview-questions#question-design).\n- **System design 2 (depending on your level, details are different)** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/hubspot-interview-questions#question-design).\n- **Behavioral** (1 hour). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/hubspot-interview-questions#question-behavioral).\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at HubSpot\n\n### Coding\n\nThis will be algorithms and data structures-focused, with LeetCode-style questions. We\u2019ve heard they usually ask LeetCode easy to mediums. While the challenge might seem easy, HubSpot wants you to catch all the edge cases and run tests.\n\nCommunication and clarifying questions are things they are looking for. They know their questions can be found online. They expect you have already seen and solved them.\n\nSome examples of the question types they ask are:\n\n- Most repeated substring of size k\n- Find the matching string pattern in a given string.\n- Find all commonly repeated strings in the 'engineering' string one. How to create an add comma function in js and add it to the global\n- Merge two sorted lists up to size k\n\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in HubSpot interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former HubSpot engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Linked Lists](/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=linked-lists)\n\n[Sliding Window](/sliding-window-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/sliding-window-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=sliding-window)\n\n[Parsing](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1   \n interview replay](/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Sorting](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=sorting)\n\n[Two Pointers](/two-pointers-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/two-pointers-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 3   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=two-pointers)\n\n### System Design\n\nYour first system design round will be very standard. You\u2019ll be asked to design something like Netflix. The main difference between HubSpot and other companies is that they aren\u2019t as obsessed with you mapping out the most optimized solution. It\u2019s more about capturing a broad answer than going deep into one solution.\n\nYour second system design will depend on which role you are interviewing for.\n\n#### Senior SWE 1 (Equivalent to L4 at other companies)\n\nYou will usually be asked to design something like a weather service. One engineer we spoke to described it as being more like application design. The areas you need to consider are:\n\n- Data storage\n- Reliability\n- Performance\n- Horizontal scaling\n- Trade-offs\n\nMake sure to ask clarifying questions before you do anything. Their interviewers are collaborative. If you bring up any technologies, you need to know them well as they will drill into them.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n#### Senior SWE 2 (Equivalent to L5 at other companies)\n\nThis system design round is split into two parts. First, you will be asked to write a document covering a past, technically challenging project and submit it for review They want you to list everything involved from start to finish, including:\n\n- An overview of business problem\n- The challenges faced\n- The technical implementation\n- Any design tradeoffs\n- The rollout plan\n- The chosen success metrics\n- Any lessons learned\n\nThey will review your write-up, and, if they like it, you will be invited to another live interview where they will ask you questions about the project.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis interview will be conducted by the hiring manager of the team you are interviewing for. It\u2019s going to be pretty standard, with situational questions. As above, they may talk about the culture at HubSpot so it\u2019s a good idea to come prepared with questions that delve into their values.\n\n### How HubSpot Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nDecisions are reached based on your performance in each round. You can still get an offer with one \u201cno-hire\u201d, but your other rounds need to be very strong for this to happen. Hiring managers may still reject candidates in the team matching phase if they see one \u201cno-hire\u201d.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

You usually apply or get brought in for a generic job listing, and then they will determine which team you interview for. Your interviewers will come from all across the org, but the hiring manager for the role you are interviewing for will usually be involved from the start. You can only interview once, but if you don\u2019t get an offer from the team you interviewed with, you may still have a chance with another team.\n\nThe entire process takes about 2-4 weeks.\n\nGeneral advice:\n\n- Instacart doesn\u2019t ask questions that require knowledge of academic or obscure data structures and algorithms. Although questions can still skew LeetCode-y, they won\u2019t be questions that require knowledge of niche trees, dynamic programming, etc. Brush up on the basics, and you should be fine.\n- Make sure you practice system design, as that interview is often make or break and is definitely used for leveling\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nInstacart\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll ask you about your previous experience, and why you\u2019re interested in Instacart. They\u2019ll also talk about the specific role and team you\u2019ve been matched with.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nInstacart\u2019s technical phone screen lasts about an hour. They use CodeSignal.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\n- **Coding** (45 mins). Like the technical phone screen, this round will be conducted in CodeSignal, and you can use any language that CodeSignal supports. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/instacart-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **Second coding**. As above.\n- **System design** (45 mins). This section is really important and usually where people fail. You can use any tooling you\u2019d like, e.g., Google Draw or Excalidraw. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/instacart-interview-questions#question-design).\n- **Behavioral** (45 mins). This interview will be conducted by a hiring manager. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/instacart-interview-questions#question-behavioral).\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Instacart\n\nA lot of Instacart\u2019s questions are created in-house, but you may run into LeetCode-style questions as well.\n\n### Coding\n\nYou\u2019ll be tested for pragmatic coding skills here. You might be asked to write a script to convert dollars to euros, get a question about API optimization, be asked about designing key-value stories, edit distance, expression evaluation, combinatorics, file I/O, or any number of other fairly practical questions.\n\nIn recent years, as Instacart has hired more FAANG alums, the question composition has shifted a bit to include more LeetCode-style questions. That said, even if you do get a LeetCode question, it will likely NOT touch on obscure algorithms or data structures.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in Instacart interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Instacart engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Binary Trees](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Matrices](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Parsing](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1   \n interview replay](/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Stacks](/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1   \n interview replay](/mocks?technical=stacks)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Hash Tables](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-tables)\n\n[Queues](/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=queue)\n\n### System Design\n\nSystem design interviews at Instacart matter a lot for leveling. The most common failure mode we heard about was passing the coding portion and then failing on architecture.\n\nSpecifically, if you want to hit at least L6, you NEED to do well in this interview.\n\nThe engineers we spoke to said that in the system design portion, it\u2019s really important to manage your time because there\u2019s typically a lot you can cover with your answer, but they are looking for you to be concise. Also be prepared to justify your design decisions.\n\nYou might be asked to:\n\n- Design a database model for an Instacart-like system\n- Design a system for tracking shipments\n- Design a system for communicating with a payment processor\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nInstacart\u2019s behavioral interviews are pretty standard fare. You\u2019ll be asked about past projects and your impact in previous roles. This interview is primarily used for leveling.\n\n### How Instacart Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nHiring decisions are made by rough consensus. There\u2019s a debrief the same day or the day after your interview loop. People vote, but ultimately the decision rests with the hiring manager. From one of the engineers we spoke to:\n\n\u201c*If there\u2019s one strong no, that\u2019s usually the end of it, and a strong yes from someone else probably wouldn\u2019t countermand that.*\u201d\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Instacart?

Help us write more guides like this one by [filling out this form!](https://iiosurveys.typeform.com/to/UVWQf8ZT) Get a free mock interview for your help.\n\nPublished: May 8, 2024\n\n## Jane Street's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Jane Street can expect the following hiring process:\n\n- Recruiter call (30 minutes)\n- Technical phone screen (1 hour)\n- Onsite (5 hours)\n\n![Jane Street\u2019s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Jane_Street_s_Interview_Process_a3566cc29a.png)\n\nAt Jane Street, the process is centralized, i.e., you interview with a central team and then get matched to a specific team after you pass the onsite loop.\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n- Work on your coding stamina - the onsite is pretty intense.\n- Practice coding something up from scratch \u2013 during the onsite, they\u2019ll ask you to build something from nothing, e.g., a Tetris game\n- Their interviewers want you to be collaborative, so ask lots of questions and communicate well throughout the process. They value collaboration as much as they do good code.\n- Read Jane Street\u2019s [blog post about their interview process](https://blog.janestreet.com/applying-to-jane-street/). Unlike most company pages, it\u2019s detailed, useful, and good, and talks a lot about engineering interviews, specifically.\n- Don\u2019t try to impress them by coding in OCaml (their internal functional language of choice). Use the language you\u2019re most comfortable in.\n\nThe entire process takes about 4 weeks.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nJane Street\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll ask you about your previous experience, why you\u2019re interested in Jane Street, your understanding of Jane Street\u2019s value proposition, and what you\u2019re looking for moving forward.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThis is a pretty standard technical round, with one LeetCode medium-style question that will have two parts. Your interviewer will be more interested in how you think and how you arrive at the solution than an optimal solution. Communicate your assumptions and discuss alternate approaches as you work your way through the problem.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\n- **3 coding / system design hybrid rounds** (75 mins each). These interviews will be conducted in CoderPad. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding / System Design section](https://interviewing.io/jane-street-interview-questions#question-coding) below.\n- **Technical project deep dive** (75 mins). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Technical project deep dive section](https://interviewing.io/jane-street-interview-questions#question-project) below.\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Jane Street\n\n### Coding / System Design\n\nWhereas the technical screen before the onsite is LeetCode-style and more academic, the coding rounds during the onsite are a little bit more practical. They also blend coding and system design so you might have to whiteboard out some pieces initially before jumping into code.\n\nYou will get a problem statement that is underspecified. Your job is to ask the right questions before you dive in and while you are working. Get comfortable building things from scratch. You might be asked to:\n\n- Design Tetris\n- Design a video player API\n\nYou\u2019ll have to design it, code it out, and go deep into the logic.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in Jane Street interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Jane Street engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Trees](/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=trees)\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Maps](/maps-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/maps-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 2   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=maps)\n\n[Matrices](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Search](/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=search)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Stacks](/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1   \n interview replay](/mocks?technical=stacks)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Memoization](/memoization-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/memoization-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=memoization)\n\n### Technical Project Deep Dive\n\nYou will be asked to present an interesting, technically complex project that you\u2019ve worked on, ideally something that you can talk about for an hour. They tell you not to over-prepare for this one, so you don\u2019t necessarily need a robust presentation, but do prepare to answer a lot of questions about the project you\u2019re presenting, the reasoning and logic behind it, and its impact.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Its purpose is to check qualifications, hear about past projects, and find out what you\u2019re looking for from LinkedIn and in general. It also acts as a culture fit check, so they\u2019ll want to see how your communication and personality align with their values. Make sure you\u2019re up to date on LinkedIn features, blog posts and news. Finally, your recruiter will make sure you understand the role you\u2019re applying for and clarify next steps in the process.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A). Just don\u2019t do it \u2013 when you give out information this early in the process, you\u2019re painting future\u00a0you into\u00a0a corner.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThe technical phone screen lasts an hour, and interviews at this stage (and beyond) will usually have two interviewers, the primary interviewer and a trainee interviewer who\u2019s shadowing.\n\nYou\u2019ll be given 2-3 algorithms and data structures questions, structured as follows:\n\n- If you\u2019re applying for a niche role (e.g., mobile), you\u2019ll get a 10-minute domain-specific\u00a0question. This question is meant to quickly \u00a0gauge your expertise on your niche subject and screen out generalists.\n- 15-minute small problem\n- 30-minute medium problem\n\n### Step 3: Second Recruiter Call\n\nIf you pass the technical phone screen, a recruiter will reach out again for a 30 minute call. Having a second recruiter call in the middle of the process is unusual, but LinkedIn does it for a good reason: they have historically lost a lot of good candidates to FAANG, and so this call is their way of playing defense to get ahead of attrition. In this call, they\u2019ll re-ask about whom you\u2019re in process with and will try to make sure that they don\u2019t lose you by moving too slowly.\n\nThough our advice about not revealing your hand stands, in this call, if you do have any tight timelines from other companies, it\u2019s good to let them know because, according to our sources, they are indeed able to speed things up and move quickly.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nLinkedIn\u2019s onsite usually lasts 5-6 hours and includes the following steps:\n\n- Coding (1 hour)\n- (For niche roles) Domain-specific coding (1 hour)\n- System design (1 hour)\n- Technical communication (1 hour)\n- Behavioral (1 hour)\n\nThe order of these rounds can vary, as well as the number of coding interviews required. Depending on your score for various portions of the onsite, you may be required to complete an extra system design, object oriented design, or algorithms interview. There may be extra rounds for certain teams and roles as well. Given that LinkedIn\u2019s interview process is centralized, you generally won\u2019t be interviewing with engineers or managers from the team you\u2019ll end up on.\n\n#### Coding\n\nThis interview will generally be one question or sometimes two, depending on how quickly you work through the first one.\n\n#### (For Niche Roles) Domain-Specific\u00a0Coding\n\nIf you\u2019re applying for a niche role (e.g., mobile), in addition to a general coding interview, you\u2019ll have to do a domain-specific interview as well.\n\n#### System Design\n\nThe [system design interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) will cover general system design knowledge and will focus on building large-scale systems. Make sure to communicate clearly and often during this interview and substantiate your design choices as well as your choices of specific technologies.\n\n#### Technical Communication\n\nThis interview will evaluate your ability to communicate and collaborate. You\u2019ll be asked about one of your past projects and then walk your interviewer through it, with an emphasis on the technical aspects of your projects. Make sure you explain what the project was, why it mattered to the business, and what you did specifically. They\u2019re expecting you to be able to dive really deep into the project you choose, so be ready to answer anything and everything about it.\n\n#### Behavioral\n\nThe behavioral interview at LinkedIn is very conversational. They\u2019re looking to assess your culture fit and will ask you ad-hoc questions rather than preset or typical behavioral interview questions. Despite it being conversational in nature, it\u2019s important to find ways to tie your answers to LinkedIn\u2019s values:\n\n- We put members first\n- We trust and care about each other\n- We are open, honest and constructive\n- We act as One LinkedIn\n- We embody diversity, inclusion and belonging\n- We dream big, get things done and know how to have fun\n\n### Step 5: Team matching\n\nAssuming all has gone well to this point, you\u2019ll be contacted by hiring managers for a team matching call. These calls are for the hiring managers to sell you on joining LinkedIn, and to create excitement about their specific orgs. It\u2019s important to use this time to ask any questions you have about LinkedIn, the role or the process so far, and find out as much as possible about your team options.\n\nOnce you\u2019re matched with a team they will extend you an offer. If you are far along in the process with other companies, make sure that you let them know that they should move quickly. This is another stage where LinkedIn loses a lot of candidates to FAANG, so they\u2019re ready and able to speed things up.\n\nIn the event you\u2019re unable to be matched with a team, your onsite results are valid with LinkedIn for 1 year, so they will continue trying to find a team for you.\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at LinkedIn\n\n### Coding\n\nLinkedIn has a company-wide question bank, though interviewers have a bit of wiggle room to change them up.\u00a0We\u2019ve heard from several sources that the question bank is fairly small (compared to other companies), and that the questions haven\u2019t changed much over the past 7 years or more.\n\nTo figure out what specific types of questions to expect in your LinkedIn interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former LinkedIn interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you\u2019re likely to encounter:\n\n[Binary Trees](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Matrices](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Stacks](/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1   \n interview replay](/mocks?technical=stacks)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n### System Design\n\nTypical [system design](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) questions include:\n\n- Design a system that will determine trending posts\n- Design a system that will log requests\n- Design a system that will show client feeds\n- Design an API for some specific use case\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n## Common LinkedIn Interview Questions\n\nBelow are common questions that interviewers from LinkedIn ask on our platform. Since our data comes from mock interviews, questions may not be exactly the same as what you'd see in real interviews.\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Subarray Sum Equals K](/questions/subarray-sum-equals-k)\n\n[Given an unsorted array of integers and an integer k, find the number of subarrays whose sum equals k.](/questions/subarray-sum-equals-k)\n\nEASY\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Two Sum](/questions/two-sum)\n\n[Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to a given target.](/questions/two-sum)\n\nMEDIUM\n\n### [Find Leaves of a Binary Tree](/questions/find-leaves-of-binary-tree)\n\n[Given a binary tree, extract all the leaves in repeated succession into a list of lists by starting at the bottom and working your way upwards.](/questions/find-leaves-of-binary-tree)\n\n## How LinkedIn Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nLinkedIn grades each onsite round on a 4-point scale, where 3 is passing. If your aggregate score after the onsite is borderline, you may get asked to do another interview.\n\nCandidates who end up over the line get passed to the hiring committee, who make the final decision about both hiring and leveling.\n\n## LinkedIn Interview Replays\n\n[![Reverse word in string](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Linked_In_1_878141e885.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nLinkedIn Interviewer\n\nReverse word in string\n\nSpace Dragon, a LinkedIn engineer, interviewed Ice Gyro in Java](/mocks/linked-in-java-reverse-word-in-string)\n\n[![Matching pairs](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FPython_Linked_In_2_d36bb244fa.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nLinkedIn Interviewer\n\nMatching pairs\n\nAdmiral Velociraptor, a LinkedIn engineer, interviewed Dystopian Pizza in Python](/mocks/linked-in-python-matching-pairs)\n\n[![Falling leaves of a tree](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FGo_Linked_In_4_adbb4c4dcb.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nLinkedIn Interviewer\n\nFalling leaves of a tree\n\nExistential Crumpet, a LinkedIn engineer, interviewed Neuro Owl in Go](/mocks/linked-in-go-falling-leaves-of-a-tree)\n\n[![Two sum](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Script_Linked_In_6_2b87fe415b.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nLinkedIn Interviewer\n\nTwo sum\n\nExistential Crumpet, a LinkedIn engineer, interviewed Chaotic Pizza in JavaScript](/mocks/linked-in-javascript-two-sum)\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at LinkedIn?

Each team interviews in its own style, and there are variations in the numbers and types of interviews you might encounter. A lot of it depends on the region you are interviewing in. You can apply to and interview for multiple roles simultaneously.\n\nYour interviewers will be selected from the team you are interviewing for by the hiring manager, based on their ability to assess you for specific skills, e.g., if the role requires you to be a Python expert, they will use another Python expert to interview you. The order of your interviews for the onsite portion is not predetermined, and the hiring manager will decide the schedule based on the availability of the interviewers deemed necessary.\n\nThe process can be quite slow, and they will not expedite things unless they feel like you are a perfect fit. Expect the process to last more than 6 weeks in most cases.\n\nGeneral advice:\n\n- There is a big focus on collaboration, so don\u2019t be combative in interviews.\n- Communication is important for leveling. They want to know if you can communicate cross-functionally or potentially manage a team in the future.\n- Practice the STAR method of answering behavioral interview questions.\n- Just because you don\u2019t get a job with one team doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed with Morgan Stanley as a whole. You don\u2019t need to wait a year to apply to other teams, and you might find a more suitable role in the course of that same job search.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll ask you about your previous experience, and why you\u2019re interested in Morgan Stanley. They\u2019ll look for basic skill set alignment. They\u2019ll also talk about the specific role and team you\u2019ve been matched with.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Onsite\n\nAgain, this will vary in terms of interview types and order depending on the team you are interviewing with, but here is a sample schedule:\n\n- **Asynchronous coding challenge** (45 mins). This challenge will be conducted in HackerRank. For some teams, this may happen before the onsite rather than as part of it. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/morgan-stanley-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **Language-specific coding** (45 mins). Morgan Stanley is one of the few companies we\u2019ve written about whose process isn\u2019t always language agnostic. For some roles and teams, they may need you to know a specific language, and if that\u2019s the case, they will do one round in that language where they\u2019re specifically vetting you for familiarity with that language and its idiosyncrasies. This round is usually conducted in HackerRank. .\n- **Data structures and algorithms** (45 mins). This round is usually conducted in HackerRank. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/morgan-stanley-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **Object-oriented programming** (45 mins). This will not be a coding interview. You\u2019ll be asked a series of questions on the topic of object-oriented programming. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Object-Oriented Programming section below](https://interviewing.io/morgan-stanley-interview-questions#question-object-programming).\n- **Behavioral** (45 mins) This is a team fit call with the hiring manager. Morgan Stanley\u2019s behavioral interviews are pretty standard fare. You\u2019ll be asked about past projects and your impact in previous roles.\n\nYou might notice the lack of a system design interview in the schedule above. This is typical for a lot of teams although you might interview for a team that includes one. If you do get a system design interview you might be asked product-focused system design questions.\n\nBe prepared for some repetition here. You should be ready to drive into your own product designs.\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Morgan Stanley\n\nManagers tend to come up with their own questions, but for core coding interviews, prepping on LeetCode will be very helpful. A lot of the teams will pull questions from there.\n\n### Coding\n\nAs above, you\u2019ll run into a lot of LeetCode-style questions here. Below are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in Morgan Stanley interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Morgan Stanley engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Binary Trees](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Inorder Traversal](/inorder-traversal-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/inorder-traversal-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 2   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=inorder-traversal)\n\n[Matrices](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Sliding Window](/sliding-window-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/sliding-window-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=sliding-window)\n\n[Binary Search](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n[Sorting](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=sorting)\n\n[Two Pointers](/two-pointers-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/two-pointers-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 3   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=two-pointers)\n\n### Object-Oriented Programming\n\nBelow are the types of questions you\u2019ll likely be asked during this interview:\n\n- Explain object-oriented programming. What is inheritance?

One candidate even had their hiring manager call first, before anything else happened! The onsite rounds can also change a lot. We will do our best to sketch out the process, but yours may differ depending on the role you are interviewing for. While there is some flexibility regarding what role you end up interviewing for, you don\u2019t seem to be able to interview for multiple teams. All of your interviewers will be from the team you are interviewing for.\n\nOne engineer we spoke to, who interviewed with Nvidia for two separate teams told us:\n\n> *If you get an early hiring manager call, you can ask them exactly what to expect in the rest of the rounds. If they say the language is the priority, brush up on those skills, if they say it will be more general, then focus on general coding.*\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n- LeetCode practice will help, but they will throw in more practical questions too.\n- They don\u2019t have an internal question bank, so the interview questions are up to the individual interviewer.\n- Nvidia puts a premium on experience and advanced academic degrees.\n- A good (senior) referral can help you skip the recruiter call.\n- Most roles they hire for are software-orientedsoftware oriented, not hardware as you might expect\n- If you fail with one team, you can immediately interview with another one, but you will have to go through the whole process again, though it\u2019s possible you\u2019ll be able to skip the technical phone screen.\n- They will always have at least one interview that is focused on the language you will need for whatever team you are joining.\n\nThe entire process takes about 6-8 weeks.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nNvidia\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll ask you about your previous experience, and why you\u2019re interested in Nvidia and do some basic skills assessment.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nYou might start with 15 minutes of general chat in this round but, the guts of the interview will be technical. In the general chat, you might be asked about your background and why you\u2019re interested in Nvidia. The technical portion will be 45 minutes long. One engineer we spoke to was asked only LLM questions here and everything was done in PyTorch, but this is largely dependent on the role you are interviewing for. Nvidia is very focused on hiring engineers with LLM experience right now so, if that\u2019s what you applied to, expect LLM questions rather than general CS skill questions. If not, expect a LeetCode medium-style question, but remember, they don\u2019t have an internal bank from what we\u2019ve heard, so you might get something more practical too.\n\nIf you are asked LLM questions, expect them to focus on concepts such as:\n\n- Mixture-of-experts model\n- Beam search\n- Autoregressive decoding with KV-cache\n- Low-rank adaptation (LoRA)\n- High-level distributed computing\n\nFor example, you might be asked to implement beam search for LLM inference and evaluate the time complexity of each operation.\n\n### Step 3: Hiring Manager Call\n\nThis is usually split into two parts. You will be asked about your background and experience in the first part. The hiring manager will be testing for culture fit. In the second part, they will be selling you on the role and team.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nThis will vary by role but here\u2019s what you can expect.\n\n- **Coding x 2** (1 hour each). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/nvidia-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **System design** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/nvidia-interview-questions#question-design).\n- **Second Coding** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding (domain-specific) section below](https://interviewing.io/nvidia-interview-questions#question-domain).\n- **Hiring Manager** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Hiring Manager interview section below](https://interviewing.io/nvidia-interview-questions#question-manager).\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Nvidia\n\n### Coding\n\nOk, things can vary quite a bit here, as with everything in the Nvidia hiring process! One engineer we spoke to had 2 low-level coding rounds that were very practical and domain-aligned for the team he interviewed with. Others got more standard LeetCode-style questions during these two rounds.\n\nWe also heard that there are different formats for the coding rounds for certain teams. You might get a problem to solve in some and have to review existing code in others, similar to a debugging round.\n\nIf the role you have applied to will rely heavily on Cuda, expect to be interviewed in C++. Every role at Nvidia is a bit different though so lot\u2019s of languages are used. It should be clear from the job description if there is a specific language required. If not, ask the hiring manager in advance so you are prepared!\n\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in Nvidia interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Nvidia engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s a list of more niche technical topics that are, in our experience, specific to Nvidia:\n\n- C++ Fundamentals\n- LLMs\n  - See the [technical phone screen section above](https://interviewing.io/nvidia-interview-questions#step-2) for examples of LLM sub-topics\n\nAnd here are technical topics that you\u2019re likely to find at other companies as well (for these we\u2019ve created detailed write-ups of their own):\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Inorder Traversal](/inorder-traversal-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/inorder-traversal-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 2   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=inorder-traversal)\n\n[Linked Lists](/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=linked-lists)\n\n[Matrices](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Binary Search](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n### Coding (Domain-Specific)\n\nThis will be a more practical round. You might be asked to reimplement an algorithm from first principles. You might get a mix of technical questions and actual coding to do. Whatever you get will be specific to the role you are interviewing for.\n\n### System Design\n\nThis will more than likely be a pretty standard system design round but, again, things vary from team to team. Brush up on the usual questions like \u201cHow would you design Twitter / Uber / a chatbot for a website,\u201d BUT they may ask you something more practical for the role. Learn about CPU/GPU architecture and anything else relevant to the team you are interviewing for!\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Hiring Manager Interview\n\nThis will be more conversational than the other rounds but could have behavioral/experience-based questions, as well as technical questions depending on the hiring manager.\n\n### How Nvidia Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nAfter the onsite, the panel all submit a scorecard. You don\u2019t need to score perfectly (it\u2019s from 1-5) on each scorecard, but it\u2019s unlikely to be hired if you\u2019ve scored poorly on even one round.\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Nvidia?

Help us write more guides like this one by [filling out this form!](https://iiosurveys.typeform.com/to/UVWQf8ZT) Get a free mock interview for your help.\n\nPublished: March 24, 2024\n\n## OpenAI's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3-4 Steps\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at OpenAI can expect the following process:\n\n- Recruiter call (30 minutes)\n- Technical phone screen (1 hour)\n- Possible 2nd technical screen or assessment, where the format depends on the role (1 hour)\n- Onsite (4-6 hours)\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n- Your recruiter will give you detailed tips on what to prepare for before some interviews. Take the tips seriously!\n- The coding questions you\u2019ll get are more practical than LeetCode. They are algorithms and data structures questions, but they are actual things that you might do at work.\n- Prepare slides for the presentation part of the onsite (even though it\u2019s not required).\n- Be prepared to discuss ethics and safety in AI. Read their blog!\n\nThe hiring process at OpenAI is decentralized, with a lot of variation in interview steps and styles depending on the role and team you are interviewing for. You will get some sort of technical assessment before the onsite, and it can be anything from a technical phone screen, an asynchronous assessment, or a take-home project. It may even be two separate steps. We\u2019ve heard they use HackerRank for asynchronous coding tests but CoderPad for live interviews. This guide will assume that there will be two live technical phone screens, but your mileage may vary depending on team and role \u2013 check out [OpenAI\u2019s own interview guide](https://openai.com/interview-guide) for more info.\n\n![OpenAI\u2019s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, 2nd Technical Screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Open_AI_interview_process_cd24f67a14.png)\n\nAt OpenAI, there is some flexibility in terms of which role and team you might end up on \u2013 you might apply to one role but have them suggest others as you move through the process. Your interviewers will probably come from multiple different teams. Prepare for it to feel chaotic.\n\nFrom one of our users who recently interviewed with Open AI:\n\n> *\u201cEverything they did made them seem wildly disorganized. They didn\u2019t stay in touch through the process. A lot of radio silence.\"*\n\nThe entire process can take 6-8 weeks, but if you put pressure on them throughout you can speed things up, especially if you mention that you have other offers.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nOpenAI\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll ask you about your previous experience, why you\u2019re interested in OpenAI, your understanding of OpenAI\u2019s value proposition, and what you\u2019re looking for moving forward.\n\nIn this round, your recruiter will also tell you what to expect in the next round, given how much variability there is in the interview process for different roles and teams. Your recruiter will also be in touch throughout the interview process to prep you for what\u2019s coming up next.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nOpenAI\u2019s first technical phone screen lasts about an hour and is conducted in CoderPad. This is an algorithms and data structures style interview, but the questions are more practical than questions you\u2019d find on LeetCode. We will cover what we know of their question style in the section called [\u201cTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at OpenAI\u201d](https://interviewing.io/openai-interview-questions#question-types) below.\n\n### Step 3: Second Technical Phone Screen or Assessment\n\nThe format of this round varies by role and will be more domain-specific than the previous round. For instance, you may get an asynchronous exercise or a take-home assignment. Or you may have to do another technical phone screen.\n\nWe expect that for many of our readers, who tend to be senior, back-end focused engineers, this round will be an architecture interview. See the [System Design section](https://interviewing.io/openai-interview-questions#question-design) below for more details on question types.\n\n*If you have more information about this part of the process or see anything that\u2019s incorrect, please fill in [our form](https://iiosurveys.typeform.com/to/LXqccdMk)*\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nOnsite interview loops also vary slightly depending on the role and seniority, but the below is generally what you\u2019ll get:\n\n- **Behavioral interview with a senior manager** (45 mins) This is a phone call with a hiring manager, typically someone quite senior at the company. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section](https://interviewing.io/openai-interview-questions#question-behavioral) below.\n- **Presentation** (45 mins) You\u2019ll be asked to prepare this in advance.

Although you will still get algorithmic questions, they are going to be about stuff you might actually do at work.\n\n> *\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get questions on string manipulation.\u201d*\n\nIn these interviews, they are looking for your ability to write code that is going to be fast enough now but flexible enough to scale and adapt in the future.\n\nYou can choose the language for the coding rounds, and the questions are picked based on whichever language you choose.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in OpenAI interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former OpenAI engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\nFirst, here\u2019s a list of more niche technical topics that are, in our experience, specific to OpenAI:\n\n- Time-based data structures\n- Versioned data stores\n- Coroutines in your chosen language (multithreading, concurrency, etc.)\n- object-oriented programming concepts (abstract classes, iterator classes, inheritance, etc.)\n\nAnd here are technical topics that you\u2019re likely to find at other companies as well (for these we\u2019ve created detailed write-ups of their own):\n\n[Trees](/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=trees)\n\n[Binary Search](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Graphs](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n[Depth-First Search (DFS)](/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=depth-first-search)\n\n[Breadth-First Search (BFS)](/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=breadth-first-search)\n\n[Recursion](/recursion-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/recursion-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=recursion)\n\n### System Design\n\nYou may get two system design rounds during the interview loop, one before the onsite and one during.\n\nIf you get one before the onsite, expect something practical \u2013 you might be asked to design Yelp, Foursquare, Twitter, or a notifications system.\n\nIn this round, they probe for depth of knowledge and will ask a bunch of follow-up questions. It\u2019s also best not to name-drop names of tools:\n\n> *\u201cIf you call out any specific technologies during this round, be prepared to go into detail about them! It may be best not to bring up specific examples as they seem to like drilling into the pros and cons of your choice.\u201d*\n\nAlthough a more domain-specific interview may pop up for some roles, most engineers will get another system design round during the onsite. You will likely be prepped well for the topic of this interview, so pay attention to any tips they give you beforehand. If you got a system design round before the onsite, the style of question that you get in the onsite round will be very similar, though they may ask you to get into more detail.\n\nWe have heard that OpenAI might ask you to code in this interview. One user told us that they designed a solution to the problem that was posed to them but were then asked to code up a new solution using a different method.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Presentation\n\nYou\u2019ll be asked to present a project you worked on to a senior manager. You won\u2019t specifically be asked to prepare slides, but it\u2019s a very good idea to do so. Be prepared to discuss the technical and business aspects and impact of the project, as well as your level of contribution, what tradeoffs were made, what other team members were involved, and what everyone\u2019s responsibilities were. You may get some behavioral questions about how you worked with the team.\n\n### Behavioral\n\n#### Senior Manager Call\n\nThis is often with someone pretty high up at OpenAI. Our sources tell us it can be an interesting call. Although a lot of the questions will be standard, you may also be asked to delve deeper into something on your resume that catches the eye.\n\nFrom one source who interviewed with OpenAI recently:\n\n> *\"This interview was with John Rizzo, who is a well-known employee at OpenAI. It wasn\u2019t an intense call, and John asked me some great questions about my background. It felt like he might have had veto power, but I enjoyed the call.\"*\n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to read OpenAI\u2019s blog, particularly any articles that discuss ethics and safety in AI. They want to know that you\u2019ve thought about the topic, so prepare yourself!\n\n#### Working with Teams\n\nThis is another type of behavioral interview you might encounter. Expect questions about times:\n\n- You had to work cross-functionally across teams\n- You\u2019ve experienced conflict between teams or roles\n- You\u2019ve had competing ideas to move a project forward within your own team.\n\nAll of these questions are meant to get at your ability to work collaboratively.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Behavioral questions will be asked in every interview. Come prepared!\n- Palantir believes in protecting civil liberties and rights. They look for people who are comfortable discussing these topics.\n- It\u2019s a mix of standard LeetCode-style questions and very non-standard questions. LeetCode prep isn\u2019t going to be enough here.\n\n![Palantir\u2019s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite, Hiring manager interview](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Palantir_interview_process_af7ed42bbf.png)\n\nAt Palantir, you apply for a catch-all backend or full stack role and team matching will happen later in the process. The process doesn\u2019t vary much between roles although there are some variations for different levels of seniority. The recruiter might adjust the track you are on very slightly through the process but you\u2019re more likely to do team matching after the onsite.\n\nThe entire process takes and 3-4 weeks but it\u2019s possible to expedite things, especially with other offers in hand.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nPalantir\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s an important step. They filter out more candidates than most companies do at this stage from what we hear. They are looking for your motivations to join the company, so come to this call prepared to discuss why you want to be there in detail. It helps to have a compelling story as to what drew you to Palantir. You might get asked about your favorite, and least favorite past projects, as well as what you want to work on moving forward. They look for any red flags indicating you won\u2019t be there long-term. An engineer who knows their process very well says:\n\n> *\u201cSurface-level motivations to join the company won\u2019t get you far and they will reject strong technical candidates if they don\u2019t seem like a good cultural fit!\u201d*\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nPalantir\u2019s technical phone screen lasts about an hour and happens in CodePair. This interview will feature algorithms and data structures but, the difference is that it won\u2019t be purely technical and the algorithm you are solving will be put in the context of something you are building for an end-user. You\u2019ll get asked to solve a problem in one half of the interview and behavioral questions in the other half. We will cover what we know of their question style in the section called [\u201cTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Palantir\u201d below](https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions#question-types).\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nPalantir has 4 types of interviews they give most engineers during the onsite loop. **You will only get 3 of the 4, but we will describe each here.**\n\nEvery onsite interview will have 20 minutes of behavioral questions!\n\n- **Problem decomposition** (1 hour). This is one of the options that you will almost definitely get. It\u2019s really important and non-standard. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Problem decomposition section below](https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions#question-problem-decomposition).\n- **System design** (1 hour). This will be conducted in CodePair using the whiteboard functionality. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions#question-design).\n- **Re-engineering** (1 hour). You\u2019ll be given a piece of code in CodePair and asked to review it for bugs. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Re-engineering section below](https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions#question-reengineering).\n- **Coding** (1 hour). This will be similar to the technical screen before the onsite, and is conducted in CodePair. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions#question-coding).\n\n### Step 4: Hiring Manager Interview\n\nThis interview will be a repeat of one of the onsite interviews. They look for red flags during the onsite and like to revisit any area they felt wasn\u2019t up to scratch. It might not even be the technical piece they want to review! Again, the behavioral questions are very important.\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Palantir\n\nWe can\u2019t stress enough how embedded behavioral questions are at Palantir. As there is no behavioral interview during the onsite, they like to assess your motivations, cultural fit, and ability to work collaboratively all through the process. Come prepared with STAR-style answers, stories about why you want to work for Palantir, and ways you\u2019ve thought about the end-user experience in other roles. If you propose a solution, talk about how it could be improved or modified for the users' benefit. You will also be asked about what projects you\u2019ve enjoyed and not enjoyed. They want to know you\u2019re OK working on all sorts of projects, not just glamorous ones.\n\n### Coding\n\nThe coding problems posed before are during the onsite will reflect the type of work you will be doing at Palantir, i.e., building products for end-users. So, while the core technical question might look like a standard LeetCode-style problem, it will be put in the context of a larger solution for an end-user. You\u2019ll have to solve the problem but also consider and discuss its impact on the whole system, and how it will be used by the user. You\u2019ll need to ask a lot of clarifying questions as it will be under-defined at first. Just keep thinking about the end-user and what trade-offs you will have to make in order to make the user experience positive. Maybe your solution is memory intensive, or maybe it's more runtime complexity intensive - think about and discuss improvements you could make to help the user in future iterations. They value user-centric thinking and empathy in finding solutions over algorithmic complexity. Think about how the user will use the code and how it could be improved, e.g., maybe you could implement caching so the user has a better experience each time they use the solution.\n\nA user who is very familiar with the Palantir interview process had this to say:\n\n> *\u201cWhat strategies do you consider for enhancing performance beyond just the code you\u2019re currently working on? Consider aspects such as caching and pre-computation to improve efficiency. Initially, your solution may not be the fastest, but implementing these strategies could significantly speed up subsequent operations.*\n>\n> *\"Expect the problem to be intentionally vague. It\u2019s important to anticipate and address any ambiguous scenarios, demonstrate caution regarding potential issues, and safeguard the system from malicious users.\u201d*\n\nRegardless of what question you get, they\u2019ll ask about decision-making, time and space complexity, etc. They want to know why you would approach a problem in a certain way, and they look for things that might cause issues with client integrations, etc.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in Palantir interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Palantir engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Search](/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=search)\n\n[Sets](/sets-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/sets-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=sets)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n[Queues](/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=queue)\n\n### System Design\n\nAgain, this will be an industry standard round bar the added behavioral aspects. Our [system design guide](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) has been called \u201cexcellent preparation\u201d by someone very familiar with Palantir\u2019s interview.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Re-engineering\n\nIn this interview, you will be given a bunch of code in CodePair and asked to review it for bugs. You\u2019ll be told how the system is supposed to work and that the output is wrong when you run the code. It will be about 500-100 lines of code, and it\u2019s really important not to get lost in the first issue you see. Review everything from top to bottom as they will probably put in red herrings to distract you!\n\n### Problem Decomposition\n\nThis is probably the most important technical round you will face. It\u2019s a non-standard interview where you will be asked to solve a high-level, real-world technical problem, with a real focus on thinking about the end-user. You won\u2019t have to write code outside of maybe some pseudocode.\n\nThe problem might be something like:\n\n*\"How would you design a technology to help elderly people with poor vision who want to cook for themselves?\"*\n\nIt will be focused on an individual or an organization. Your goal is to come up with how to use technology to solve this problem. A lot of the focus here is on breaking the problem down into its component parts so you can tackle it. You\u2019ll need to think about the time your solution will take, as well as how the respective parts of the solution might be built by different teams.\n\nThere will be two parts:\n\n- Ideation: Break the problem down into its respective pieces and propose a solution to each. Agree on the solution with your interviewer.\n- Execution: How you would design the solution at a high-level. This is more like system design. You won\u2019t need to go too deep technically, e.g., you won\u2019t need to provide detail on the type of database you would use, but you might discuss the type of data / schema you\u2019d need to solve the problem.\n\nThe important thing here is, as with other rounds, to focus on the end-user. Think about how your solution would be used. Discuss ways to make it better. You\u2019re being asked to display both your ability to problem-solve and your ability to empathize with users/clients.\n\n### Hiring Manager Interview\n\nAfter the onsite, the interview panel meets with a hiring manager to discuss your performance. If you pass, they\u2019ll match you with a team that needs your skillset. From there, you\u2019ll interview again with the hiring manager for that team. This will be your final round and it will repeat one of the above rounds. If they see a red flag around motivation or culture fit, they\u2019ll be looking to test you on it again.\n\n### How Palantir Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nThe final decision rests with the hiring manager you interview with last from what we can tell.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Help us write more guides like this one by [filling out this form!](https://iiosurveys.typeform.com/to/UVWQf8ZT) Get a free mock interview for your help.\n\nPublished: February 8, 2024\n\n## Rippling's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Rippling can expect the following process:\n\n- Recruiter call (15-30 minutes)\n- Technical phone screen (1 hour)\n- Hiring manager screen (1 hour)\n- Onsite (3-4 hours)\n\nGeneral Tips:\n\n- Rippling places a big emphasis on testing and running code during interviews\n- Grinding on LeetCode medium and hard questions will help - you will need to move fast!\n- System design round is used for leveling\n\n![Rippling\u2019s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Hiring manager screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Rippling_Company_Process_78740d50a1.png)\n\nRippling has a decentralized hiring process, which means that you interview for a specific role and will most likely be interviewed by people from that team, including a hiring manager. They seem to have recently moved to a decentralized process from a centralized one.\n\nThe entire process takes about 4-6 weeks but can be completed in as little as two weeks. Getting a referral might help you skip certain steps like online assessments and initial recruiter screens, but this seems to vary by team.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nRippling\u2019s recruiter call lasts up to 30 minutes, and, if you\u2019ve gotten referred in, it isn\u2019t an assessment. The recruiter will introduce you to the company and walk you through the interview process. Without a referral, you may get some light behavioral questions.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nRippling\u2019s technical phone screen lasts about an hour and is conducted in CodePair. It will feature LeetCode-style questions. We will cover what we know of their question style in the section called [\u201cTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Rippling\u201d below](https://interviewing.io/rippling-interview-questions#question-types).\n\n### Step 3: Hiring Manager Screen\n\nThis round can vary depending on team and location. Some hiring managers will use this round to discuss team fit, your background, and the scale and scope of projects you\u2019ve worked on in a general sense.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard that other hiring managers will ask you to present a project you\u2019ve worked on and answer questions about it. You will know in advance. If you have to present a project, it\u2019s wise to create slides. You will be asked about workflows and processes, what you were responsible for, what you learned, and what you might do differently. Either way, you will have time to ask questions, so come prepared.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\n- **Coding** (90 mins). This interview will be conducted in either your own IDE with screen-share or in CodePair. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/rippling-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **System design** (1 hour). Different teams at Rippling use different tooling here. We\u2019ve even heard of one team asking for sketches to be done on paper! For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/rippling-interview-questions#question-design).\n- **Coding** (1 hour). This round will be in CodePair. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/rippling-interview-questions#question-coding).\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Rippling\n\nRippling does ask LeetCode-style questions. Most will be LeetCode medium-level, but we have heard of some harder questions being asked.\n\n### Coding\n\nThere are two coding interviews during the onsite.\n\n**The 90-minute coding interview** will have two parts. In the first one, you will be asked to build something. In the second, you will discuss what you built, what you could have done differently, how you would scale it, etc. This interview will be fairly practical. You might be asked to prepare a simple HTTP server and then write some simple REST APIs.\n\n**The 1-hour coding interview** will be LeetCode-style, but the questions will build on each other. You might be asked to design a data structure where you can get objects, insert objects, and get the average of all the objects in the data structure in a given time.\n\nFrom one of our users:\n\n> *\u201cYou\u2019ll need to get comfortable with LeetCode medium and hard questions \u2013 you won\u2019t have time to figure it out on the day. You need to work at a Meta-like pace.\u201d*\n\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in Rippling interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Rippling engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Binary Trees](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Trees](/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=trees)\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Matrices](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Stacks](/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1   \n interview replay](/mocks?technical=stacks)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Recursion](/recursion-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/recursion-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=recursion)\n\n### System Design\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t encounter anything too unusual here. You might be asked to design a news recommendation engine, a shopping recommendation engine, or a file-sharing system. The key here is to recognize the tradeoffs between approaches early and articulate them. Do move fast though, as they\u2019ll ask a lot of questions about scaling. They are looking for breadth and depth of system design experience here, and this interview is often used for leveling.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Moreover, the people interviewing you won\u2019t necessarily be from your future team (and likely won\u2019t be).\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nThis step doesn\u2019t happen 100% of the time. It depends on whether Robinhood recruiters reached out to you or whether you applied. If you applied, you do the recruiter call, and it\u2019s standard stuff. They\u2019ll discuss the role, expectations, your previous work history and Robinhood itself.\n\nIt\u2019s really important at this stage not to reveal your salary expectations, salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies.

If you haven\u2019t interviewed at a company that uses Karat before, it\u2019s basically interviewer-as-a-service \u2013 companies pay them to conduct interviews on their behalf. This means that the person you\u2019ll be talking to isn\u2019t a Robinhood employee and won\u2019t be able to answer questions about the team, roadmap, projects, etc. Their only objective is to screen you.\n\nThere are 30 minutes for each section, the coding portion will often feature one or two medium difficulty questions, whereas the system design will focus on general knowledge in a trivia-like format.\n\n### Step 3: Second Recruiter Call\n\nThe second recruiter call is meant primarily to prep you for the onsite, especially if you didn\u2019t do the first call.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nThe onsite at Robinhood consists of 5 interview rounds with the following steps:\n\n- Coding (1 hour)\n- System design (2 hour)\n- Past project review (1 hour)\n- Hiring manager call (1 hour)\n\n#### Coding\n\nThis is an algorithms and data structures interview. Robinhood places an emphasis on correctness over scalability. These interviews typically happen in CoderPad.\n\n#### System Design\n\nTypically, the onsite interviews include two [system design interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) rounds, each covering different aspects. One interview assesses your familiarity with a wide range of system design concepts, emphasizing high-level and well-rounded solutions. The other interview will delve into a specific facet of system design, challenging you to problem-solve in a more targeted area (e.g. front-end system design).\n\n#### Past Project Review\n\nThe past project round will evaluate your ability to communicate about technical topics. You\u2019ll be asked to prepare something ahead of time based on a prompt. Be ready to discuss what you bring in depth. An example prompt is: Prepare a system diagram of a previous project.\n\n#### Hiring Manager Call\n\nRobinhood\u2019s hiring manager call is a standard assessment of behavioral and cultural fit. The discussions are centered around role-related scenarios, with the aim of gauging problem solving and communication abilities.\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Robinhood\n\n### Coding\n\nRobinhood has a question bank with company-specific versions of common questions, but it\u2019s not mandatory for interviewers to use, so there will often be a mix of those and other standard medium difficulty coding problems.\n\nTo figure out what specific types of questions to expect in Robinhood interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Robinhood interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you\u2019re likely to encounter:\n\n[Binary Trees](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Trees](/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=trees)\n\n[Linked Lists](/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=linked-lists)\n\n[Maps](/maps-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/maps-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 2   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=maps)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n### System Design\n\nThese questions will usually revolve around Robinhood\u2019s own product, or adjacent/related products.\n\nCommon [system design](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) questions at Robinhood include:\n\n- Build Twitter\n- Design stock exchange\n- Design a new feature for Robinhood\n- Build Google Docs\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\nFAANG Interview in Design Robinhood\n\nAdvance this person to the next round?\n\n![Thumbs up](/static/images/recordings/thumbs_up.svg)\n\nTechnical Skills:\n\n3/4\n\nProblem Solving Ability:\n\n4/4\n\nCommunication Ability:\n\n3/4\n\n[More Details\n\n![New Tab](/static/images/NewWindow.svg)](/mocks/faang-system-design-design-robinhood)\n\n## How Robinhood Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nRobinhood uses a hiring committee to make decisions, except in cases where there is a low volume of candidates for a role. In the event there is a hiring committee, those who participated in the interview directly will come together to discuss and review performance, before coming to an agreement on hire or no hire.\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Robinhood?

You interview for one specific role, and most of your interviewers, with one exception, will come from the same team.\n\nThe stages in the process vary depending on the seniority and role you are interviewing for, with managers having a lot of scope to customize the process for their open roles.\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n- Referrals will help you get a recruiter call.\n- They look for a good match between a candidate\u2019s skills and the role, so make sure your resume matches the job description you apply to.\n\nThe entire process takes about 6-8 weeks. By default, they tend to schedule interviews quite far apart compared to other companies, but if you push you can sometimes move things along.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nIf you get a recruiter call, it\u2019s a great sign that they are genuinely interested. Recruiters will often send resumes to hiring managers before they even take a call so you\u2019ve done well to get this far already. The recruiter call itself lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll ask you about your previous experience, why you\u2019re interested in Roblox, and what you\u2019re looking for moving forward.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThere is some variation in the type of screen you might get here, with more senior roles sometimes getting a system design interview. Most mid to senior-level backend and full stack engineers will get a coding round. It will be conducted in CodeSignal. We will cover the types of questions you can get here in the [Coding section](https://interviewing.io/roblox-interview-questions#question-coding) below.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nSometimes you\u2019ll get a recruiter prep call before the onsite. You can split the onsite interviews and complete them over a week or two. The mix of interviews can vary by team, and the more senior you are, the more rounds you can get, but this is what most candidates can expect.\n\n- **2 x Coding** (1 hour). These interviews will be conducted in CodeSignal. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section](https://interviewing.io/roblox-interview-questions#question-coding) below.\n- **1-2 x System design** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section](https://interviewing.io/roblox-interview-questions#question-design) below.\n- **1-3 Behavioral** (1 hour). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section](https://interviewing.io/roblox-interview-questions#question-behavior) below.\n\n### Step 4: Bar Raiser Interview\n\nIf you pass the onsite, the final round will be a bar raiser interview. The style of this interview is unique to Roblox. They will give you a technical problem, likely one they have faced at Roblox in the past, but it will be designed to take you out of your comfort zone. It\u2019s not a coding exercise but more a test of your creativity, intelligence, values and ability to navigate tricky situations.\n\nAn example of the type of technical problem might be that people are finding ways to bypass the Roblox moderation system and post inappropriate content.\n\nThe problem [in the Bar Raiser interview] will be something uncomfortable for you - something you can\u2019t assign normal CS best practices to. It\u2019ll be a weird situation.\n\n> *The problem [in the Bar Raiser interview] will be something uncomfortable for you - something you can\u2019t assign normal CS best practices to. It\u2019ll be a weird situation.*\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Roblox\n\n### Coding\n\nRoblox\u2019s coding questions will be LeetCode medium in terms of difficulty but won\u2019t necessarily be LeetCode-style. They will try to place problems in a situational context that is relevant to the type of work you will do there, although you will use algorithms and data structures in your solutions. They aren\u2019t trying to trick you with anything too difficult, but they do want to see clean code. For Roblox, it\u2019s not just about solving the problem, you have to write clean code, run test cases, compile the code etc.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in Roblox interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Roblox engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Matrices](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Search](/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=search)\n\n[Parsing](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1   \n interview replay](/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Dynamic Programming](/dynamic-programming-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/dynamic-programming-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=dynamic-programming)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n[Sorting](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=sorting)\n\n### System Design\n\nRoblox\u2019s system design rounds come in two different styles. One is a standard system design round, and the other is a deep dive into a system you have previously designed or been involved in. If you only get one round during the onsite, it will likely be the former.\n\nFor the standard interview, you might be asked to build something like Minesweeper. For the project deep dive, you will be asked to explain how you built something and what the tradeoffs were.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nYou might have as many as 3 behavioral rounds at Roblox. They can be with the engineering manager, director of engineering and/or VP of engineering overseeing the role you are interviewing for. The interview with the engineering manager and director are standard behavioral interviews, where you will be posed situational questions, and can use something like the STAR method to answer them.\n\nThe VP interview is different. It can seem more casual in terms of their tone, but it\u2019s a really critical interview. If you get one of these interviews it\u2019s a good sign that other rounds have gone well, but it is also a round many fail due to treating it casually. They will likely start by going through your resume but will find something to drill down into. They want to hire engineers they can be proud of, so if you have something on your resume, be prepared to justify why it is there and why it makes you a good hire. You might get asked about the project you\u2019re most proud of. Don\u2019t just give them a project that had a successful outcome; show them something that makes you stand out.\n\n> *Don\u2019t be just a nice guy, be impressive, think about your resume and your stories.*\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Each of their orgs is called [*Something* Cloud](https://rainmakercloud.com/blog/2022/01/18/the-15-types-of-clouds-in-salesforce-and-their-features), so if you\u2019re interviewing at the org level, it might be for, say, Marketing Cloud or IoT Cloud, and which team you end up on will be determined after you interview. That said, how each team or org runs their own process is up to them.\n\nIf you end up applying to an org rather than a specific team, you'll do team matching within the org *before* you get your offer numbers.\n\nFinally, our sources tell us that while Salesforce is pretty quick to move for a company of their size once you actually start interviewing. The time from the\u00a0first interview to offer can take as little as 3 weeks, but they may take a while to get that first interview scheduled.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nThis is a typical recruiter call, where they\u2019ll ask about previous experience, relevant projects, and why you\u2019re interested in Salesforce and the specific team/org you\u2019re targeting. They\u2019ll also elaborate on the role and confirm that your experience and expectations are a good match.\n\nOne important thing \u2013 if you\u2019re primarily a back-end engineer, let your recruiter know as soon as possible so they route you accordingly. If you don\u2019t, and you end up saying you\u2019re full-stack when you\u2019re really not (or when you haven\u2019t touched front-end work in a long time), you might be in for a rude awakening in your coding rounds when you have to traverse the DOM or build progress bars in JavaScript. Even though \u201cfull-stack\u201d can mean any number of different things depending on the company, at Salesforce, they really mean it!\n\nFinally, it\u2019s really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687335664411636&usg=AOvVaw2y437xxXrTm2-9NHDgDz1y). Just don\u2019t do it \u2013 when you give out information this early in the process, you\u2019re painting future\u00a0you into\u00a0a corner.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThe structure and content of the technical phone screen at Salesforce is team-dependent, as is tooling. One tool you\u2019re likely to see, though, is [Quip](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://quip.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687335664412626&usg=AOvVaw2T-Hsd2TxcJCXmUQdS56j8)\u00a0(their answer to Google docs).\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nSalesforce\u2019s onsite lasts roughly 4 hours and consists of the following steps:\n\n- Coding (2 hours)\n- System design (1 hour)\n- Behavioral (1 hour)\n\n#### Coding\n\nSalesforce\u2019s onsite usually has 2 coding interviews. As with the technical phone screen, tooling varies, but you might have to use Quip (their answer to Google docs).\n\nThese are the most important parts of the onsite \u2013 both the system design and the behavioral rounds don\u2019t carry as much weight.\n\n#### System Design\n\nThis round lasts 1 hour and may also happen in Quip.\n\n#### Behavioral\n\nThe behavioral round is probably the least important out of all the onsite rounds. You\u2019ll get the usual questions about past projects, your contributions, strengths and weaknesses, and so on.\n\nThat said, Salesforce really values [the concept of Ohana (family)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.salesforceben.com/what-is-the-salesforce-ohana/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687335664414005&usg=AOvVaw07sLrrAY1tLtQnQilgsbZ6), and you may get questions about the importance of community, supporting your team, the importance of customer relationships, and so on.\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Salesforce\n\n### Coding\n\nOne unique aspect of this round is more of an emphasis on specific programming language skills (rather than the type of language-agnostic interview you might see at FAANGs and many FAANG-adjacent companies).\n\nMoreover, if you\u2019re applying for a full-stack role, you may get front-end or back-end questions, and which you get is up to your interviewer. One typical question is, \u201cBuild a progress bar in JavaScript\u201d. If you\u2019re primarily a back-end engineer who\u2019s done some front-end work in the distant past, questions like this may be really jarring..\n\nIt\u2019s less likely than at other companies that you\u2019ll get LeetCode-style questions, but you might\u00a0(again, what you get is team-dependent). However, if you do get them, they\u2019re going to be easy to medium (rather than medium to hard, as you might see with other companies we\u2019ve written about), and our sources tell us that if you practice the top 10 medium-difficulty questions on LeetCode, you\u2019ll be in good shape.\n\nBetween the above and cross-referencing it with our own data-set of mock interviews, if you do\u00a0get back-end, algorithmic questions in your coding interviews, these are the types of questions you\u2019re likely to encounter:\n\n[Binary Trees](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Trees](/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=trees)\n\n[Linked Lists](/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=linked-lists)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Hash Tables](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-tables)\n\n### System Design\n\nThe kinds of questions you\u2019ll get here vary a lot from team to team and may be anything from database-related questions (including writing SQL) to design questions about CRMs (not surprising, given that Salesforce is a CRM company).\n\nYou should also study up on the internal tooling the org/team you\u2019re interviewing for uses, as you are likely to get questions about that (e.g., [technologies they\u2019ve acquired somewhat recently](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.salesforceben.com/the-10-biggest-salesforce-acquisitions/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687335664415978&usg=AOvVaw2o8Gsi-xA72ccuDkWEvMRj)\u00a0like Slack, Quip, Tableau, etc.).\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n## Common Salesforce Interview Questions\n\nBelow are common questions that interviewers from Salesforce ask on our platform.

Help us write more guides like this one by [filling out this form!](https://iiosurveys.typeform.com/to/UVWQf8ZT) Get a free mock interview for your help.\n\nPublished: June 26, 2023\n\n## Shopify's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps\n\nFor a mid to senior-level software engineer, Shopify\u2019s process (usually) looks like this:\n\n- Recruiter call (30 minutes)\n- Technical phone screen (40 minutes)\n- \"Life Story\" interview (1 hour)\n- Onsite (3-4 hours)\n\n![Shopify\u2019s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Life Story interview, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Shopify_s_Company_Process_2d50eabf8f.png)\n\nShopify\u2019s process is decentralized, which means that you interview for a specific team out of the gate.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nThe first recruiter call lasts 30 minutes. Its purpose is to check qualifications, hear about past projects, and find out what you\u2019re looking for from Shopify and in general. It also acts as a culture fit check, so they\u2019ll want to see how your communication and personality align with their values. Make sure you\u2019re up to date on Shopify features, blog posts and news. Finally, your recruiter will make sure you understand the role you\u2019re applying for and clarify next steps in the process.\n\nThis is a typical recruiter call, but shorter. It\u2019s primarily meant to gauge your interest in Shopify and lay out the rest of the process. There will be a more detailed recruiter call, called the \u201cLife Story\u201d interview, later on.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s still really important not to reveal your salary expectations or your salary history. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A). Just don\u2019t do it \u2013 when you give out information this early in the process, you\u2019re painting future\u00a0you into\u00a0a corner.\n\nNormally, we\u2019d also advise you not to reveal where you are in process with other companies, but we\u2019ve heard from our sources that Shopify is very good at moving quickly if you\u2019re getting close to offer stage with other companies, so if you need them to move, make sure to mention that in this call (you don\u2019t have to go into detail about which companies you\u2019re talking to, just that you\u2019re getting close to offers or have some already).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThe technical phone screen at Shopify is a data structures/algorithms interview conducted via CoderPad. There will likely be 2 interviewers conducting this round.\n\n### Step 3: \"Life Story\" interview\n\nThis interview is conducted by a recruiter, who will be asking you questions about your past to see what motivates and drives you: is there some common thread that\u2019s been a theme or shown up in multiple places in your story and your career to date? Their goal is to suss out whether you\u2019re a \u201c3D person\u201d who can communicate effectively with others, instead of just someone who\u2019s technically gifted. Because Shopify is fully remote, they place extra importance on having employees who are personable and able to have a chat.\n\nYou may also be asked to sign [Shopify\u2019s code of conduct](https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_downloads/Governance%20document/2019/Code-of-Conduct-as-amended-May-29-2019.pdf) (we were able to find this copy from 2019; please email us to let us know if it\u2019s no longer valid).\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nShopify\u2019s onsite lasts roughly 4 hours and includes the following steps:\n\n- Pair programming (2 hours)\n- Technical deep dive (1 hour)\n- Possibly system design (1 hour; usually just for senior/staff-level engineers)\n\n#### Pair Programming/Coding\n\nYou\u2019ll have two separate pair programming sessions as part of your onsite.\n\nIn these interviews, you\u2019ll be using your IDE of choice and sharing your screen.\n\nWhen you practice for this interview, get in the habit of talking out loud about what may work even if it's not ideal, and explain to the interviewer what you would do differently, or how you would improve it if you had more time. The goal isn\u2019t just to solve the problem, but to show that you know what you\u2019re doing and are able to consider the long-term effects of your design decisions.\n\n#### Technical Deep Dive\n\nIn this interview, you\u2019ll be doing a deep dive on a project you worked on, why it mattered, your contributions, how you overcame challenges, and so on. Be prepared to discuss technical details in depth.\n\n#### System Design\n\nYou may not get a separate system design interview in your loop \u2013 those are reserved for senior (and sometimes staff-level candidates). There will be a system design component in your pair programming sessions, however.\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Shopify\n\n### Coding/Pair Programming\n\nYou\u2019re more likely to get LeetCode-style questions in the technical phone screen, rather than the onsite.\n\nTo figure out what types of questions to expect in your Shopify interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Shopify interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you\u2019re likely to encounter:\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Hash Tables](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-tables)\n\nDuring the onsite, you will not get LeetCode-style questions. Rather, you will iteratively build something with your interviewer. You\u2019ll start with the simplest possible implementation and then add features to it, testing as you go. Depending on how the interview is going, your interviewer will likely add on up to three additional layers of complexity, and what started as a simple problem will end up with a system design component as well.\n\nExample questions include:\n\n- Design and implement an LRU cache\n- Given a list of products with a price and popularity rating, order them based on price and use popularity as a tiebreaker\n- Implement a discounting feature for retail\n\n### System Design\n\nIf you do get a [system design round](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview), be prepared for high-level system design questions that will likely expect a tie into a feature/design relevant to Shopify\u2019s product.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n## Common Shopify Interview Questions\n\nBelow are common questions that interviewers from Shopify ask on our platform.

Instead of Leadership Principles, they evaluate candidates on their adherence to Snap\u2019s values: \u201cWe are Kind, \u201cWe are Smart\u201d, and \u201cWe are Creative\u201d. Note that Snap\u2019s behavioral evaluations are spread across all of your interviews, so, unlike most companies, there isn\u2019t a dedicated behavioral interview. Make sure to keep the Snap values in mind during your rounds. They\u2019re also looking for product knowledge and passion for Snap in every interview, so make sure you\u2019re familiar with the app and ready to talk about it. Review their values and specifically their engineering values before heading into your interviews!\n\nFinally, Snap has a bar that\u2019s been described to us as \u201cunexpectedly high\u201d, and exactly how high can vary from team to team.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nSnap\u2019s recruiter call is pretty typical, but in addition to the standard recruiter questions, they may ask you product questions or want to hear about your usage of the app and its features. Be sure to spend some time playing around with their product before going in.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThe technical phone screen at Snap is a data structures/algorithms interview via HackerRank (their interview tool, not the async assessment tool). Depending on the interviewer, there may also be some light behavioral questions in this round (as we mentioned earlier, behavioral questions will be sprinkled throughout the process).\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe onsite at Snap consists of 6 interview rounds with the following steps:\n\n- Coding (4 hours)\n- System design (1 hour)\n- Q&A (30 minutes to 1 hour)\n\n#### Coding\n\nThere are generally four interviews focused on algorithms and data structures. The main thing they\u2019re looking for besides a working solution that actually runs is speed.\n\n#### System Design\n\nThe [system design interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) at Snap will focus on high-level system design questions and will likely expect a tie into a feature/design relevant to their product.\n\n#### Q&A\n\nOnce you\u2019ve wrapped up your technical interviews, you\u2019ll get the chance to chat with a hiring manager and ask any burning questions you may have about Snap. This round isn\u2019t meant to be an evaluation and does not factor into whether you get an offer.\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Snap\n\n### Coding\n\nSnap's coding questions come from a company-wide question bank and are usually LeetCode-style questions ranging from medium to hard difficulty.\n\nTo figure out what types of questions to expect in your Snap interviews, we did 2 things. First, we spoke to some current and former Snap interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you\u2019re likely to encounter:\n\n[Sets](/sets-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/sets-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=sets)\n\n[Parsing](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1   \n interview replay](/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Hash Tables](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-tables)\n\n[Queues](/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=queue)\n\n### System Design\n\nTypical questions include:\n\n- Design a chat app\n- Design an ad server\n- Design a photo sharing app\n- Design a document management system\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n## Common Snap Interview Questions\n\nBelow are common questions that interviewers from Snap ask on our platform.

Once you receive and accept your offer, you\u2019ll begin the team matching process (given that team matching comes after an offer in their process, we didn\u2019t officially include it as part of the interview).\n\nThis process can take several weeks (or longer in some cases), and consists of multiple calls with different interested hiring managers from across Snap.\n\n## Snap Interview Replays\n\n[![Deep copy linked list](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FPython_Snap_1_f3fbacca55.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nSnap Interviewer\n\nDeep copy linked list\n\nDJ Cyclone, a Snap engineer, interviewed Massively Parallel Hedgehog in Python](/mocks/snap-python-deep-copy-linked-list)\n\n[![Copy list with random pointers](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FC_Snap_2_65608ecd94.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nSnap Interviewer\n\nCopy list with random pointers\n\nDJ Cyclone, a Snap engineer, interviewed Parallel Prism in C++](/mocks/snap-cplus-plus)\n\n[![Print linked list reverse](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FC_Snap_3_0c0955c3f8.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nSnap Interviewer\n\nPrint linked list reverse\n\nDJ Cyclone, a Snap engineer, interviewed Epic Rainbow in C++](/mocks/cplusplus-print-linked-list-reverse)\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Snap?

You\u2019ll also generally be interviewing with members of the team you\u2019ve applied to.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nSnowflake\u2019s recruiter call is pretty typical. They\u2019ll ask about your background and interests, and how they relate to the role you\u2019re interviewing for. In some cases this call will also replace the hiring manager call, depending on if the recruiter is aware of exactly what the hiring manager of the specific team is looking for.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter). Just don\u2019t do it \u2013 when you give out information this early in the process, you\u2019re painting future\u00a0you into\u00a0a corner.\n\n### Step 2: Hiring Manager Call\n\nWhether you talk to a hiring manager or not depends on which team you\u2019re applying for and the relationship that the hiring manager and the recruiter have \u2013 if the hiring manager feels that the recruiter is well-calibrated, they may opt to skip this step.\n\nIn the event that you do speak with a hiring manager, they\u2019ll talk to you about your background and see how well it fits with the role and their specific team. They\u2019re looking to see how well your passions, interests, and previous experience ties into the Snowflake values as well, and how it will translate into your role. Ideally, they\u2019d like to see some overlap in your hobbies and the things you\u2019ll be doing at work.\n\nThe hiring managers at Snowflake are encouraged to share all good candidates with other teams, so even if you\u2019re not a good fit for their exact team, they may help you find something else.\n\n### Step 3: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThe technical phone screen at Snowflake consists of BOTH a data structures/algorithms interview AND A system design interview. That\u2019s why it takes 2 hours. These are conducted via CoderPad and Zoom.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nIn addition to having a strong back-end focus, Snowflake\u2019s interviews test your ability to perform within a specific team. It\u2019s also important to note that since Snowflake is a database company, a lot of the interview questions will involve having some more database expertise and knowledge than your average company.\n\nSnowflake\u2019s onsite is usually virtual and takes place over Zoom using CoderPad. While the type/amount of rounds may vary from team to team, generally you can expect to see the following depending on your level:\n\n##### **Mid-to-senior (IC3 and 4):**\n\n- **Presentation (30 minutes)**: This interview is usually with multiple engineers from the team you\u2019re applying for and is an opportunity to showcase a past project in a way that highlights your technical ability and foundational knowledge.\n- **Coding (1 hour)**\n- **Expertise (1 hour)**: This is a technical interview that will touch on skills relevant for the specific team you\u2019re interviewing for. It may be coding, system design, or both. Or it could be a deep dive into a specific language or framework (again depending on the team).\n- **Behavioral (1 hour)**: This interview is usually with a project manager but sometimes a hiring manager will do it, depending on your team.\n- **Close (1 hour)**: This is a final call, with a recruiter or a senior leader (depending on the team), to answer any last questions about the role and team, and to potentially wrap up any loose ends from previous rounds.\n\n##### **Principal (IC5 and above):**\n\n- **Presentation (30 minutes)**: Same as mid-level above.\n- **Coding (1 hour)**\n- **Expertise (1 hour)**: Same as mid-level above.\n- **Behavioral (1 hour)**: Same as mid-level above.\n- **Cross-functional (1 hour)**: This will be an interview with members from multiple teams across Snowflake who will come prepared with their own questions as it pertains to their department and your potential team.\n- **Close (1 hour)**: Same as mid-level above.\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Snowflake\n\n### Coding\n\nFor coding interviews, you can expect algorithmic questions that are around a LeetCode medium, but with a Snowflake-specific twist and a focus on database internals. An example question is: Get a log file, aggregate the logs, and do it in a way that won\u2019t take too long.\n\nEven if the questions aren\u2019t pure LeetCode, they will touch on a variety of technical topics. As such, to figure out what technical topics to expect in your Snowflake interviews, we did 2 things. First, we spoke to some current and former Snowflake interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes with our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you\u2019re likely to encounter:\n\n[Binary Trees](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Binary Search](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Hash Tables](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-tables)\n\n[Memoization](/memoization-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/memoization-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=memoization)\n\n### System Design\n\nThis interview will focus more on data systems and database design, and the generic \u201cDesign Instagram\u201d types of questions are much less common.\n\nAn example question could be: Take in events that happened at a certain time, keep track of and organize them so that you can retrieve them quickly, and insert new events quickly while keeping track of the tradeoffs.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n## Common Snowflake Interview Questions\n\nBelow are common questions that interviewers from Snowflake ask on our platform. Since our data comes from mock interviews, questions may not be exactly the same as what you'd see in real interviews.\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Decode String](/questions/decode-string)\n\n[Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.](/questions/decode-string)\n\n### How Snowflake Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nOnce you\u2019ve finished your onsite, the team you\u2019re interviewing with at Snowflake will meet and discuss your performance, review the interviews and make a decision. This usually takes a few days, after which you\u2019ll receive feedback for each round and find out whether or not there\u2019s an offer.\n\n## Snowflake Interview Replays\n\n[![Decode string](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FPython_Snowflake_1_7e14aae6af.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nSnowflake Interviewer\n\nDecode string\n\nSupreme Kraken, a Snowflake engineer, interviewed Stealthy Hawk in Python](/mocks/snowflake-python-decode-string)\n\n[![ID generator](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FC_Snowflake_2_1e71c2aa2c.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nSnowflake Interviewer\n\nID generator\n\nWinged Avenger, a Snowflake engineer, interviewed Ghost Koala in C++](/mocks/cplusplus-id-generator)\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Snowflake?

You apply to a general job posting, and the recruiting team will decide if they want to have a call. After you speak with them, they will shortlist your profile and show it to different hiring managers. If a hiring manager thinks there is a good fit, you\u2019ll move forward to speak with them. If you make it through that call and an offline coding assessment, you\u2019ll head to the onsite phase where you\u2019ll be interviewed by engineers from the hiring manager\u2019s team.\n\nTo work at SpaceX you need to be a permanent resident and/or citizen of the United States.\n\nFrom what we\u2019ve been told, the entire process can take about four weeks.\n\nGeneral advice:\n\n- Go onsite in person. They put a lot of stock in personal relationships, and visiting the site is worth it!\n- They don\u2019t need you to get to full solutions, focus on asking the right questions and showing them how you think about the problems.\n- LeetCode is helpful for practice, but they are really looking for your ability to solve real-world challenges and pull from your experience.\n- Invest a lot of time in the presentation\n- Know [Elon Musk's 5-step Design Process](https://modelthinkers.com/mental-model/musks-5-step-design-process).\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nSpaceX\u2019s recruiter call lasts 15 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll ask you about your previous experience, and why you\u2019re interested in SpaceX\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Hiring Manager Call\n\nThis is usually a hybrid call, with some questions about your experience and some technical questions. As the hiring manager has picked your profile from a shortlist, they will have seen something in your background that they want to delve into. After that, you might get a system design question that relates to your previous work or the team you are interviewing with.\n\n### Step 3: Asynchronous Coding Assessment\n\nThis assessment should take you 3 hours, but you have 2 weeks to complete it. It takes place on Codility. Expect medium-level LeetCode questions that you can find online but with slightly different descriptions.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nThe onsite can be virtual or on-location. As above, try to actually go onsite if possible. Seeing the rockets alone is worth it but, they also like to meet people in person. You\u2019ll get an additional 45 mins to have lunch with the recruiter. This is a great time to ask good questions and build rapport.\n\n- **Facility tour** (if in person, 25 mins) The recruiter will walk you around the site.\n- **Prepared project/source code presentation** (1 hour). You\u2019ll be asked to suggest five ideas ahead of time, and they\u2019ll pick the one they\u2019d like you to present in person. The presentation will be in front of the entire team. This is a really important step in the process. You\u2019ll be asked to present your project and some of the source code (if possible), and they will ask lots of questions throughout your presentation. Keep Elon Musk\u2019s 5-step Design Process in mind here. They look for simplicity in your approach.\n- **Coding** (1 hour). This will likely be in CodeSignal. There might be some design elements here in addition to coding, and it will usually relate to SpaceX. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/spacex-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **Lunch** (if onsite, 45 mins) This will be with the recruiter and is a great time for you to ask good questions.\n- **Second Coding** (1 hour). This will likely be in CodeSignal and is usually conducted by two interviewers. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/spacex-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **System design** (1 hour) For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/spacex-interview-questions#question-design).\n- **Behavioral** (1 hour) This interview is with the hiring manager. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/spacex-interview-questions#question-behavioral).\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at SpaceX\n\n### Coding\n\nDon\u2019t expect LeetCode-style questions at the onsite stage. Instead, you\u2019ll see hybrid questions that have an algorithmic component, a coding component, and a design component. SpaceX likes to ask questions that make you think and draw on previous experience. A lot of their coding questions will bear some relation to real-world SpaceX problems. Talk through your approach, as it\u2019s more important to show how you think than to reach a full solution.\n\nFrom one of our users who recently went through SpaceX interviews:\n\n> *The coding portion was more about normal logic and problem-solving design questions which did not require deep algorithmic knowledge: more about understanding the problem, asking the right questions, and providing SIMPLE and scalable design.*\n\nA sample question might focus on spare parts for rockets and how to keep track of them as they move in and out of refrigeration. You may have to write code that tracks and logs the time each spare part is out, for instance.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in SpaceX interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former SpaceX engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Binary Search](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Stacks](/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1   \n interview replay](/mocks?technical=stacks)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Sorting](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=sorting)\n\nOutside of the topics above, you may see questions about data hazards, memory management, and generally questions that get at your understanding of how programming works under the hood (e.g., compilers).\n\n### System Design\n\nHere you will likely be presented with a relatively straightforward design task but not given many details. For instance, you might be asked to design an inventory management system that\ninvolves multiple locations and items, similar to the example in the coding section above, except that in this interview, you\u2019ll be focusing more on the design and less on the coding parts. In the inventory management system question, you\u2019ll have to:\n\n- Design database tables for managing spare part inventory\n- Think about how to handle movement and transfers of items\n- Discuss how you would do this at scale.\n\nNote that these questions will intentionally sound simple, and your interviewer will not provide a lot of details \u2013 they\u2019re looking to see how you deal with ambiguity and how you ask questions to fill in the blanks.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThe behavioral interview is another critical step in the process. It\u2019s possible that you perform well in this interview but poorly in one or more coding sessions yet remain in the process. If that happens\u2019 you\u2019ll likely be asked to do another coding interview.\n\nExpect to encounter similar questions to the [Amazon Leadership Principles](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles) type of interview during this round.\n\nOne engineer we spoke to also said they were asked how they felt about working with Product Managers. They told SpaceX it wasn\u2019t always necessary to work with one and the interviewer seemed happy. It\u2019s possible they do not have PMs.\n\n### How SpaceX Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nDecisions are at the hiring manager's discretion but they look for consensus. If you fail a round you might be asked to complete an additional interview. For example, if you fail one of the coding rounds, you might get another to complete.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Usually, you will meet the hiring manager and one other engineer on the team. The rest of your interviewers will be from other teams. One exception to this rule is high-profile teams, in which case you may meet with 2 different engineers from that team.\n\nBecause you\u2019re interviewing with a specific team from the outset, there is no additional matching round. However, for open-ended roles or in cases where you did well in your interviews, but the original team wasn\u2019t a fit for whatever reason, they\u2019ll pass you to a call with hiring managers where they sell you on joining their teams instead.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nThis is a typical recruiter call, where they\u2019ll ask about previous experience, relevant projects, and why you\u2019re interested in Spotify. They\u2019ll also elaborate on the role and confirm that your experience and expectations are a good match.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A). Just don\u2019t do it \u2013 when you give out information this early in the process, you\u2019re painting future\u00a0you into\u00a0a corner.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThe exact process can vary from team to team. Generally, you\u2019re asked technical trivia questions and some values-based questions, followed by coding.\n\nHow interviews are conducted also varies. The most frequently used tools are Coderpad, HackerRank, and in some cases, you\u2019ll be asked to share your screen and use your IDE while you work through the problems you\u2019re given.\n\nFinally, you may be asked to describe a past relevant project you\u2019ve worked on. Make sure you\u2019re prepared to demo and/or go into detail.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nSpotify\u2019s onsite usually lasts 4 hours and consists of the following steps:\n\n- Case Study (1 hour)\n- Coding (1 hour)\n- System design (1 hour)\n- Behavioral/Values (1 hour)\n\nThe order of these rounds can vary, as well as the number of coding interviews required. Depending on your score for various portions of the onsite, you may be required to complete an extra system design, object oriented design, or algorithms interview. There may be extra rounds for certain teams and roles as well. Given that Spotify\u2019s interview process is centralized, you generally won\u2019t be interviewing with engineers or managers from the team you\u2019ll end up on.\n\n#### Coding\n\nThe technical interview will consist of domain-specific questions, values-based questions, and a few medium to hard difficulty LeetCode-style questions.\n\nAs with the technical phone screen, tooling is team-dependent.\n\n#### System Design\n\nFor the system design interview, Spotify wants to see a broad and general understanding of the system design process, they'll also mix in domain specific questions. Generally the questions will follow the format of \"Design a system that does (x)\" with an opportunity for follow-up questions on scalability.\n\nSpotify uses [Mural](https://mural.co) for system design interviews.\n\n#### Case Study\n\nThe most important round in Spotify\u2019s onsite is the case study interview. In this interview, you\u2019ll be presented with a very open-ended real-world problem that may require debugging a system to figure out what\u2019s wrong with it or to figure out why some process has stalled.\n\nSome system design diagrams may be shared with you, along with fake terminals, code snippets, and so on.\n\nThis interview requires lots of dialogue and critical thinking, and the expectation is that you\u2019ll ask your interviewer a bunch of questions. Successful candidates will have a broad understanding of the software engineering process itself, as well as a broad understanding of the system design process.\n\n#### Values/Behavioral\n\nSpotify places great importance on their values and on candidates being good culture fits. Their values are as follows:\n\n- Innovative\n- Collaborative\n- Passionate\n- Playful\n- Sincere\n\nIn this interview, you\u2019ll get a series of behavioral questions that try to get at the following (taken verbatim from their careers site):\n\n- Do your values align with our values?\n- Do you take ownership of your work and take pride in what you deliver?\n- Are you adaptable?\n- Are you collaborative?\n- Are you driven?\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Spotify\n\n### Coding\n\nThis interview usually has a few medium to hard difficulty LeetCode-style questions.\n\nTo figure out what types of questions to expect in your Spotify interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Spotify interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you\u2019re likely to encounter.\n\n[Binary Trees](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[MapReduce](/mapreduce-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/mapreduce-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=mapreduce)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Depth-First Search (DFS)](/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=depth-first-search)\n\n[Breadth-First Search (BFS)](/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=breadth-first-search)\n\n### System Design\n\nFrom what we\u2019ve heard, Spotify\u2019s [system design interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) follows the format of \u201cDesign a system (or feature) that does X\u201d followed by a discussion about scalability, concurrency, and/or load balancing.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n## Common Spotify Interview Questions\n\nBelow are common questions that interviewers from Spotify ask on our platform.

We\u2019ll get to that later.\n\n![Stripe's interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Recruiter Call, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Stripe_s_Company_Process_938ad18527.png)\n\nStripe has a hybrid process. Their eng team is divided into two orgs: Product and Infrastructure. You interview for a specific org, but your interview loop will have engineers involved from across the company, as well as a hiring manager from the specific org you are interviewing for. There is likely some flexibility in terms of which team in that org you end up on. That discussion usually happens post-onsite. You will have the opportunity to discuss team placement during the onsite interview with the hiring manager.\n\nThe entire process takes about 6 weeks but can be completed in as little as 2 weeks, particularly if you are a referral, according to our sources.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nStripe\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll ask you about your previous experience, why you\u2019re interested in Stripe, your understanding of Stripe\u2019s value proposition, and what you\u2019re looking for moving forward. They\u2019ll also review the specific role you\u2019re applying for to make sure you understand the expectations and requirements and go over the hiring process.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. [We\u2019ve written a detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nStripe\u2019s technical phone screen lasts about an hour. You can use either your own IDE and share your screen or you can just use CoderPad. They leave it up to you; whatever you\u2019re most comfortable with.\n\nExpect the unexpected here i.e., they won\u2019t ask standard LeetCode-style questions. We will cover what we know of their question style in the section called \"[Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Stripe](https://interviewing.io/stripe-interview-questions#question-types)\" below.\n\nThe hiring managers at Stripe are encouraged to share all good candidates with other teams, so even if you\u2019re not a good fit for their exact team, they may help you find something else.\n\n### Step 3: Second Recruiter Call\n\nThis is an informational call to help prepare you for the onsite.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nAt this point, candidates split into different loops depending on the role they are interviewing for e.g., ML, frontend, backend etc. Onsite interview loops also vary slightly depending on the role and seniority, but the below is generally what you\u2019ll get:\n\n- **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in either your own IDE with screen-share or in CoderPad. Your choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/stripe-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in either your own drawing tool with screen-share or in Whimsical. Your choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/stripe-interview-questions#question-design).\n- **Bug bash** (1 hour). You\u2019ll be given a piece of code and will have to find the bug(s). They usually pick something that they\u2019ve actually seen before, so it will be a generic version of a real Stripe bug. In this round, they\u2019re looking for you to approach the problem thoughtfully and test different approaches, rather than just barreling into something and hitting a wall\n- **[For roles below Staff] Integrations** (1 hour). You\u2019ll be asked to use the Stripe API here, and it will be based on real-world integrations they've seen their merchant customers create. If you interview in the Integrations org, you will not get this round.\n- **[For Staff roles and above] Presentation** (1 hour). You\u2019ll have to write a one pager about a past project and present this to a staff-level engineer, and one other, more junior engineer who will take notes. You\u2019ll be asked to explain it, and the panel will assess your ability to communicate both via written word and to a live technical audience. They want to test your ability to give business context or rationale for what you did, and your ability to justify technical decisions. They may also ask you what you\u2019d do in situations where constraints changed on the fly. They will assess the scope of the project and probe for your use of soft power to get the project done. This interview is particularly important for leveling \u2013 if candidates can\u2019t effectively communicate the business impact of their work, for instance, they may be down-leveled.\n- **Behavioral** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted by a hiring manager or a \u201cLeveler\u201d \u2013 someone who interviews across a lot of levels and tries to maintain a consistent bar, similar to a Bar Raiser at [Amazon](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/stripe-interview-questions#question-behavioral).\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Stripe\n\nAll of Stripe\u2019s interview questions are created in-house. They run questions through tests internally via mock interviews. They are tested for fairness and fun-ness. Don\u2019t expect industry standard questions here. Be prepared to encounter something unusual but hopefully interesting! Stripe really values proactivity and independent thinking so their questions are aimed at testing you for those skill sets.\n\nStripe\u2019s questions are language-agnostic but might change a little bit depending on the language used. They playtest the questions internally to figure out if they are easier or more difficult in certain languages, and the interviewer will adjust as needed during your interview.\n\n\u201cStripe is not for everyone\u201d is something we heard often while writing this piece. You get a lot of freedom to do things you think are important, but that comes with the responsibility to deliver. If you thrive in that kind of culture you\u2019ll do well, but if you like to operate in a more rigid structure with very clear instructions and deliverables, you might not enjoy it there.\n\nStripe does not ask LeetCode questions, and grinding on LeetCode may end up being counterproductive. Instead, they tend to be practical questions that originate with the work that Stripe engineers do every day. This means that while computer science fundamentals matter, questions designed to get at them will not be formulated the same way as LeetCode problems.\n\n### Coding\n\nThis interview will be less algorithms and data structures heavy than the LeetCode-style of interview you\u2019re probably used to. Expect questions like:\n\n- How would you build a simple version of Identity Access Management?\n- How would you blur credit card numbers from logs?\n- Design a rate limiter in any programming language\n\nRegardless of what question you get, they\u2019ll ask about decision-making, time and space complexity, etc. They want to know why you would approach a problem in a certain way, and they look for things that might cause issues with client integrations, etc.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in Stripe interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Stripe engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Search](/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=search)\n\n[Parsing](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1   \n interview replay](/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n### System Design\n\nThis round focuses mostly on large systems and will involve designing an entire service with scalability, reliability, and usability concerns in mind. What technologies would you use and why? What are you optimizing for? Would you use a relational or non-relational database? How would caching work? And so on.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis varies by role. For IC roles you\u2019ll be asked about your own experiences. For management roles, you will be asked about how you would handle certain scenarios (e.g., underperforming direct reports, conflict in your org, etc.).\n\nLike Amazon, Stripe has some principles they harken back to when evaluating your responses. They\u2019re called [Operating Principles](https://stripe.com/jobs/culture) (the analog to [Amazon\u2019s Leadership Principles](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles)). Unlike Amazon, however, you won\u2019t be asked behavioral questions in other rounds, just like this one.\n\n### How Stripe Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nThe entire onsite panel submits written feedback after the interviews are completed and then meets to discuss. Most of the time, decisions are reached by consensus (everyone agrees to hire or no-hire), but in cases where consensus isn\u2019t possible, the hiring manager has final say.\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Stripe?

We have heard that certain teams do not allow this, but for the most part, it\u2019s safe to apply to multiple positions. As each team manages its own headcount and process it is unlikely that you will be able to skip any steps for one team that you\u2019ve already completed for another, i.e., you\u2019ll still have to complete the full process each time. Your interviewers will all come from the team you are interviewing for.\n\nAs a lot of TikTok\u2019s engineers are based in China, particularly their senior managers, you can expect to have interviews that overlap with Chinese business hours (e.g., Sunday evenings, other evenings).\n\nUnlike other companies where your virtual onsite will have all of your interviews scheduled on the same day, at TikTok you are likely to do one interview at a time, having to pass each one to get to the next.\n\nThe entire process takes about 5 weeks, although it can move much faster, especially if you let them know that you need to have your interviews complete by a certain date, e.g., if you have competing offers. TikTok is very amenable to moving quickly if they think there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll lose out, but you\u2019ll have to actively and repeatedly remind your recruiter to move faster.\n\nGeneral tips for interviewing with TikTok:\n\n- Be prepared to interview during Chinese business hours and even to be asked questions in Mandarin if you\u2019ve added it to your resume.\n- Be prepared for huge variations in the process between teams. TikTok is hiring like crazy, and they don\u2019t have an official process.\n- Practice LeetCode-style questions! They rely heavily on these questions in your first few technical rounds.\n- If you need them to move quickly, they can, but you have to really push and keep pushing. That goes for scheduling, and it goes for getting an offer in a timely fashion as well. If you keep bringing up that you have another offer, they\u2019ll move.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nTikTok\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s more informational than anything else. You\u2019ll be briefed on the process and prepared for the first interview. You may also be asked some questions about the company and your background.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\nIf you have offer deadlines coming up and need TikTok to move faster, mention that on this call, and keep reminding your recruiter of it. We\u2019d advise not going into details about where you\u2019re interviewing til you\u2019re ready to start negotiating (read more how to manage your negotiations at the start of your job search), but we do advise hammering home the point that you\u2019re in a rush (if you are).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nTikTok\u2019s first technical phone screen is relatively straightforward and should only take about 30 minutes. It\u2019s usually done in HackerRank. If you brush up on LeetCode questions, you should do fine here.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nAt TikTok, there isn\u2019t a discrete onsite portion of the hiring process. Instead, you will do each interview one by one and have to pass them one at a time to move forward. That said, once you get past the first technical screen, the order will look similar to other company\u2019s onsite interviews. Onsite interview loops also vary depending on the role and seniority, but the below is generally what you\u2019ll get:\n\n- **Coding** (1 hour). This is much more challenging than the technical phone screen and should last about an hour. The interview is usually conducted by someone on the team you are interviewing for and will use HackerRank. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/tiktok-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be in HackerRank and will be conducted by a hiring manager on the team. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/tiktok-interview-questions#question-design).\n- **Behavioral** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted by a skip-level manager. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/tiktok-interview-questions#question-behavioral).\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at TikTok\n\nThe types of questions asked at TikTok vary by team, but you can expect a lot of industry-standard LeetCode-style questions.\n\n### Coding\n\nExpect LeetCode-style questions here. Most teams are language agnostic. The first interview will be fairly simple, based on feedback we\u2019ve gotten. The second one is a lot harder. A few of the engineers we spoke to recommended brushing up on synchronized read/write locks for the second interview, in particular.\n\nOutside of concurrency and threading, below are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in TikTok interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former TikTok engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Binary Trees](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Matrices](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Binary Search](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Parsing](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1   \n interview replay](/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Dynamic Programming](/dynamic-programming-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/dynamic-programming-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=dynamic-programming)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n[Depth-First Search (DFS)](/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=depth-first-search)\n\n[Breadth-First Search (BFS)](/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=breadth-first-search)\n\n### System Design\n\nThis round focuses mostly on large systems and will likely involve designing an entire service with scalability, reliability, and usability concerns in mind. Some example questions:\n\n- [Design LeetCode](https://interviewing.io/questions/design-leetcode). What technologies would you use and why? What are you optimizing for? How would logging work for every single user action on such a large scale? And so on.\n- Design a system that can handle logging on a large scale for every single user action. Imagine 100k users are coming in and there are 5 different services. Each service has to do its own logging and send it to one final database. How would you do this?\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis varies by role, but be prepared to discuss your background, impactful projects you\u2019ve worked on, and times you\u2019ve shown initiative.\n\nCulture fit seems to be very important to TikTok, even as they are growing so fast. Their teams are based mainly in China so that brings its own unique flavor, and you should be prepared for it.\n\n### How TikTok Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nThis varies from team to team, but it\u2019s likely at the discretion of the hiring manager, with input from other team members.\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at TikTok?

Right now, it looks to be a hybrid, and practically speaking, that means if you were to apply today, you might be matched with a specific team at the outset or you might do team matching at the end. We\u2019ve seen both, and it appears to be a function of how niche your skills are (e.g., if you\u2019re an ML engineer, you\u2019ll likely be matched with a specific team at the outset).\n\nThat said, your interviewing panel will likely all be from the same org and use a company-wide, internal question bank. Candidates tend to interview for only one role, and though the process is somewhat standardized, the hiring manager will have a say in what the process will look like as well, so expect a little bit of variance.\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n- LeetCode practice will help a lot with the coding portion. The system design interviews are pretty standard as well.\n- They want you to write code that runs during coding rounds.\n- Referrals will help; you may even be able to skip the technical phone screen with one.\n- Be prepared to be grilled on your past experience and projects, particularly during the Collaboration and Leadership and Bar Raiser rounds.\n- If you go through team matching, it may take a while (weeks to months).\n\nThe entire process takes about 4-6 weeks but possibly longer if you end up having to do team matching.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nUber\u2019s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it\u2019s pretty standard fare \u2013 they\u2019ll speak about the role and team you are interviewing for, discuss salary, location, and level expectations, and ask about your interest in Uber.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We\u2019ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nAlthough we heard from one engineer that they were able to skip this stage with a referral, most senior engineers will get a pretty standard technical screen here. It will be conducted in CodeSignal, and there may be one or two questions. The questions themselves will be algorithmic. They have an internal bank of questions that most interviewers use, some of which are versions of real problems that Uber has had to solve in the past, and some of which are standard algorithmic questions with some Uber-isms papered over the top, but there does seem to be some variance. Either way, expect LeetCode medium in terms of difficulty.\n\nIt\u2019s important to write fully compilable code here, i.e., code that runs. You should also run test cases.\n\nOne engineer, familiar with the process told us:\n\n> *You might get slightly harder questions first, and it\u2019s OK to ask for help. If you do solve it without help, it\u2019s a definite pass, but you can still pass with help assuming your communication skills etc. are good.*\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThis will vary slightly by role but most engineers can expect something like this:\n\n- **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CodeSignal. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/uber-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **Second coding (depth in specialization)** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CodeSignal. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/uber-interview-questions#question-coding).\n- **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CodeSignal. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/uber-interview-questions#question-design).\n- **Collaboration and Leadership** (75 mins). This is with the hiring manager for the role. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Collaboration and Leadership section below](https://interviewing.io/uber-interview-questions#question-collaboration).\n- **Bar raiser** (1 hour) This is with a special bar raiser interviewer. For more infor about what questions to expect, the [Bar Raiser section below](https://interviewing.io/uber-interview-questions#question-bar-raiser).\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Uber\n\n### Coding\n\nThis round will be just like the technical phone screen \u2013 they have an internal bank of questions that most interviewers use, some of which are versions of real problems that Uber has had to solve in the past, and some of which are standard algorithmic questions with some Uber-isms papered over the top. If you get LeetCode-style questions, they\u2019ll be of medium difficulty or slightly harder. Note that you may get two questions, but if you do, they\u2019ll likely be mediums.\n\nYou should get in the habit of running test cases, if it\u2019s not something you do by default already..\n\nBelow are the technical topics you\u2019re likely to encounter in Uber interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Uber engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Linked Lists](/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=linked-lists)\n\n[Matrices](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Binary Search](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Parsing](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1   \n interview replay](/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions   \n& tips](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10   \n interview replays](/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n### Second Coding (Depth of Specialization)\n\nWe\u2019ve heard from multiple engineers that this round is sometimes just another LeetCode-style coding round but sometimes it\u2019s not an algorithmic question at all. This round is meant to be more reflective of the role you are interviewing for and may include some design aspects.\n\nOne engineer we spoke with said:\n\n> *This round is supposed to be more focused on [a mix of code and] designing\u2026 where you might have to build a mobile game like Snake, but in reality it\u2019s very similar to the first coding round, and interviewers often use something from the internal question bank.*\n\nNote that your recruiter may not be prepared to set expectations for this round, as there seems to be a lot of variability in how it\u2019s run, possibly at the request of the hiring manager. Ask as much as you can about the round beforehand, but be prepared for a possible curveball.\n\n### System Design\n\nMost of the people we interviewed told us to expect a very standard system design round, so you shouldn\u2019t expect many surprises here. That said, they have an internal bank of questions that are based on old problems they had to solve at Uber so you might be asked to solve one of those. You might be asked to design a map that shows every Uber driver in the world. It won\u2019t be a typical distributed systems question (like design a chat app), and you will need to focus on scale. Think about Uber in the early days and the problems they had to solve.\n\nYou\u2019ll see other, more standard, questions such as:\n\n- Design Dropbox\n- Design Facebook Messenger\n- Design a ride-sharing app (surprise!)\n- Design a card game\n- Design an industrial system\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) to help you prepare.\n\n### Collaboration and Leadership\n\nThis interview will be conducted by the hiring manager for the role you are interviewing for, or in some cases, a hiring manager from the same org.\n\nThere seem to be two distinct styles used:\n\n- You will be asked to go through past projects and how they were delivered\n- You will be asked how you *would* deliver potential projects\n\nThe hiring manager can take this in any direction they see fit,but they are looking to test your ability to work on a team, your ability to deal with failures, and your leadership skills. Have your past projects ready to discuss in detail, they might drill down into one specific project if it seems interesting. Be able to quantify both your impact and the impact of the project.\n\nIf the role is a speciality role, they might ask you questions that are relevant to it, e.g., if the role includes some frontend aspects, be prepared for some frontend questions.\n\n### Bar Raiser\n\nOk, this is where things get serious. If you\u2019ve made it this far, it\u2019s a good sign. We only spoke to one Uber engineer who did not get a bar raiser round and got hired. Everyone else told us that you need to pass one to get hired and that they sometimes won\u2019t schedule it if the rest of your onsite hasn\u2019t gone well.\n\nSimilar to [Amazon](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon#amazon), which is known for this type of interview, the bar raiser interviewer will be a specialty interviewer from across the company. They won\u2019t be part of the team you are interviewing for. They will choose the focus on the interview. We\u2019ve heard it\u2019s usually a reverse system design / project introspection style of interview, but if you weren\u2019t strong in one of the other onsite rounds, it might be a repeat of that.\n\nIf it is a reverse system design / project introspection interview, they will likely ask you to discuss one past project in deep detail. They will ask questions around:\n\n- The technical complexity of the project\n- The project\u2019s impact\n- The high level architecture decisions and the pros and cons associated\n- The time it took to complete the project and/or reach each milestone\n- Any failures\n\nBe prepared to quantify the project\u2019s impact where possible. The project discussed should match the level of seniority you are interviewing for in terms of scale and scope. A staff engineer will need to talk about a project that spans at least 2 or 3 quarters of work for example, but a senior engineer can use something a little less complex. They are looking for your depth of knowledge here and this round is used for leveling. It\u2019s probably the most important round you will have.\n\n### How Uber Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nThe entire interview panel meets, and the decision should be unanimous. If there is a mixed signal, people on the panel can try to convince others until they achieve consensus. Typically, one soft no-hire can be turned around, but one strong no-hire will be enough to reject you. In rare cases, the Bar Raiser interviewer can also overturn a hire decision.\n\n## Uber Interview Replays\n\n[![K closest elements](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Uber_2_c1be7b108e.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nUber Interviewer\n\nK closest elements\n\nBlue Centurion, an Uber engineer, interviewed Mutable Pigeon in Java](/mocks/uber-java-k-closest-elements)\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Uber?

You interview for a specific team from the get-go, and not only the content of the interviews, but the types of interviews themselves, vary significantly from team to team, so take the list above with a grain of salt.\n\nOne other somewhat unique aspect of VMware\u2019s process is their commitment to the Rooney Rule, i.e., [committing to interviewing at least one woman and one minority candidate for every open position](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/19/no-job-hire-made-unless-minority-candidate-interviewed-vmware-ceo.html). In practice, sometimes the entire process for a role will get stalled until recruiting can find those candidates, and all candidates who are not from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds may end up in an indefinite holding pattern.\n\nFinally, a word about VMware\u2019s eng culture. VMware wants to find very technical people who are interested in solving hard problems but also want to go home at the end of the day. VMware\u2019s sales cycles are slow \u2013 there\u2019s just one big release every year, so they don't need to find people who are willing to work really long hours or people whose job is to make sure that the build tool chain is on the cutting edge (and in fact, most of their customers, who tend to be huge enterprise organizations, don't want cutting edge).\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nThis is a typical recruiter call, where they\u2019ll ask about previous experience, relevant projects, and why you\u2019re interested in VMware. They\u2019ll also elaborate on the role and confirm that your experience and expectations are a good match.\n\nIt\u2019s really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A). Just don\u2019t do it \u2013 when you give out information this early in the process, you\u2019re painting future\u00a0you into\u00a0a corner.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThis is a 1-hour long algorithmic interview. You will likely be using [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io) in your technical phone screen, but tools vary from team to team.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nDepending on the role, you may have a virtual onsite or an in-person onsite. In either event they follow similar formats. The exact composition will vary not only with the team but with your seniority \u2013 if you\u2019re a mid-level engineer they will be more focused on coding. If you\u2019re very senior, your interview will be much more about what you\u2019ve done in the past \u2014 your work history, your work style, technical decisions you\u2019ve made and so on. At the highest levels, the interview will feel more like an exchange of stories rather than vetting for a specific skill.\n\nSome of your questions will invariably involve VMware-specific products and knowledge, so make sure you do some background research before heading in.\u2018\n\nThat said, VMware\u2019s onsite lasts between 5 and 6 hours and consists of the following rounds:\n\n- Coding (1 hour)\n- (For niche roles) Domain-specific coding (1 hour)\n- System design (1 hour)\n- Technical communication (1 hour)\n- Behavioral (1 hour)\n\nThe order of these rounds can vary, as well as the number of coding interviews required. Depending on your score for various portions of the onsite, you may be required to complete an extra system design, object oriented design, or algorithms interview. There may be extra rounds for certain teams and roles as well. Given that VMware\u2019s interview process is centralized, you generally won\u2019t be interviewing with engineers or managers from the team you\u2019ll end up on.\n\n#### Coding\n\nAt minimum there will be two algorithms and data structures interviews in your onsite loop. Your interview will happen in CoderPad if it\u2019s remote, but if it\u2019s in person, it\u2019ll be on a physical whiteboard.\n\n#### System Design\n\nThere will be one or two design rounds depending on your specific role and focus.\n\n#### (Potential) Hiring manage round\n\nThe main purpose of this round is to chat about your past projects and work experience, and they\u2019re very focused on your ability to communicate technical details clearly and concisely. Try to come prepared to talk about projects that are relevant to VMware and its values.\n\n#### Behavioral\n\nThis call\u2019s aim is to assess your fit for VMware and will focus heavily on the company\u2019s values and mission.\n\n## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at VMware\n\n### Coding\n\nCoding questions will focus on algorithms and data structures, and while the questions asked can vary depending on the role, you\u2019ll likely see medium to hard-difficulty LeetCode style problems.\n\nTo figure out what types of questions to expect in your VMWare interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former VMWare interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with our own data-set of mock interviews.
