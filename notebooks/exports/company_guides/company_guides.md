## Google’s interview process and questions

Google’s interview process consists of the following steps:

- Recruiter call
- Technical phone screen (and possibly a second technical phone screen)
- Onsite
- Team matching

Before we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Google’s job interview process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.

All human organizations behave like a metaphor; Google isn’t a sports team, or a family, or an army. It’s a cool grad school. Larry and Sergey set up their offices based on the model of a Stanford campus on purpose. They wanted to create an environment and company culture where people can feel chill enough to talk about anything. In general, Google interviewers tend to be more collaborative than other FAANG interviewers. At Google, the slower you go, the faster you get there.

Google has one big, centralized interview process that’s completely divorced from which team you might end up on, which means that you will NOT, however, be interviewing with your future team members – Google has a horde of interchangeable technical interviewers who have all been trained on the same process. If you do well, there will be a team matching component at the end.

At Google, because the process is centralized, you cannot interview with multiple teams concurrently, which means you don’t get multiple shots on goal. Not only that, but Google has a limit for how many chances they’ll give you before you’re blocked from interviewing again.

“You can interview three times in 5 years. If you fail all three times then you can’t interview at Google again: you’re blocked.”

Note that recently, there have been rumblings of Google changing their process to something more decentralized, where a hiring manager chooses you for a team *before* you interview, nullifying the need for post-onsite team matching. As far as we know, this new model is being tried out right now, but the change hasn’t been adopted company-wide.

Google also has rules for candidates who *pass* their interviews:

“If you pass Google’s onsite, and end up not taking the offer, your “passing of the onsite '' is good for about a year. And if you choose to re-engage in that time, the process varies widely. Usually you can skip the phone interview. Most times you have to do the full or partial onsite. If you choose to re-engage, tell their recruiters ‘I already passed the onsite’ and push to get as many steps skipped as you can.”

Google is not results-oriented. They’re process oriented. In other words, they care more about the “How” than the “What”. You’ve heard it before, and it’s true – they don’t need you to get to the optimal solution, but they do need to be impressed by your thought process. Because of this, Google is more attracted to comfort with ambiguity than speed.

Oddly, in spite of using a centralized interview process, Google doesn’t have in-depth training for its interviewers; it may surprise some candidates that there’s a larger-than-expected number of bad interviewers at Google.

“There is one thing that always bothered me about the Google interview process. And it's something that a lot of candidates don’t realize. There are a lot of bad interviewers at Google. Mostly because there are a lot of highly talented people who think they know everything.

I was the interviewer for the third interview round at in-person onsite. And I saw the candidate was there by himself; the second interviewer wasn’t there. The candidate was alone because the second interviewer got frustrated – they thought the candidate wasn’t worth the time for an onsite, so they left early.”

#### Anecdote from an Interviewer Who Worked at Google and Facebook

“Google is more likely than Facebook to design questions on purpose to be tricky. At Google, sometimes this is intentionally disguising technical questions to look like X but they’re really Y. And other times at Google, it’s designing a technical question such that if a candidate doesn’t ask a particular question they likely won’t get the answer.”

Google’s technical phone screen is a coding interview that focuses exclusively on data structures and algorithms questions. Your interviewer will ask you to write code to solve a specific problem.

One idiosyncratic aspect of Google’s process is their insistence on using Google docs for writing code (versus other companies which tend to use tools like CoderPad). This can be a bit jarring for those of us who are used to writing code in an IDE that does things like auto-indentation, auto-complete, syntax highlighting, adding missing parentheses or brackets etc. Despite not using an IDE, your interviewer will expect you to produce syntactically correct code. This is really hard.

Before your Google interview, you should practice in Google docs so you don’t forget to close parentheses or indent your code.

That said, more recently, Google has started interviewing using an internal tool with syntax highlighting, indentation and brackets completion. Whether you get to use it or not depends on your geography.

### Step 2.5: (In some cases) Another technical phone screen

The second phone screen happens only if the first one did not produce enough signal to move forward. Perhaps you didn’t communicate your thought process well enough, your code wasn’t of good enough quality, or you weren’t fast enough – but it’ll be only one of these – if you struggled with two or all three, most likely you aren’t moving forward.

If you do get scheduled for a second phone screen, push your recruiter to give you detailed feedback so you can do better the second time – nothing beats knowing *exactly* where you need to improve. You probably won’t get a response, but if you do it’s a large boost to your prep.

If you get a second phone screen it will be very similar to the first in terms of structure and content.

The Google onsite usually includes 4-6 rounds. Recently, there have been some internal experiments with the format, but generally the rounds are primarily coding, and secondarily system design. Some candidates get a single behavioral round, and others get to skip it.

The more experience you have, the higher proportion of system design and domain-specific questions you can expect to be asked.

## Google’s interview types in detail

As we mentioned above, Google is process-oriented rather than results-oriented. As such, communication during coding and system design rounds is more important at Google than the end result.

**The most important rounds at Google are coding. In fact, Google is the only FAANG company that considers coding to be more important than system design**. Google’s coding rounds are about complexity more than speed. Their interviewers are allowed to ask anything they want, so it's more likely you might get a question you’ve never practiced before.

Google interviewers are more likely than any other FAANG company to purposefully design a question so it tricks candidates. For example, they’ll disguise a question to look like it’s Three Sum, but that’s a red herring – it’s not a Three Sum problem. It just looks like one.

A lot of what you’ll see in the onsite coding mirrors what you saw in the technical phone screen. During the onsite, you may see your interviewer layer more complexity on top of questions – they’ll design a question where they plan for you to get to the solution, then when you do they’ll move the goalposts and say something like: “Remember that assumption we made earlier about [X thing]? Let’s remove that. How would that change your approach?”

“At Google, I’ve passed more people that *arrive at the optimal solution without coding it* than I do people who *arrive at the optimal solution and code it*. The actual code you write is less important than the thought process.”

“Google is highly unstructured. Everyone can ask whatever they want.”

Even though they can ask whatever they want, Google interviewers have a question bank too, but the bank is much much bigger than Facebook’s bank and, like Facebook’s bank, it’s community maintained. Some interviewers never deviate from the bank, and others don’t touch it, preferring instead to formulate their own unique questions..

This speaks to Google rewarding the “how” (aka “how a candidate got there”) or their thought processes. It also speaks to Google rewarding comfort with ambiguity. Other FAANGs have specific niche topics they love hearing and talking about (such as “performance” at Amazon), but Google is more abstract. Google might love speaking about and asking about ambiguity more than any other FAANG.

Finally, Google’s coding questions are never practical. They are always theoretical. They will never ask you to pull up your own environment and write a program. They will also never ask you to take a solution to a coding problem and apply it to a real world scenario. When prepping for Google, only practice theoretical questions.

For everything you need to prepare for Google’s coding interview, check out the section called "[Google coding interview preparation resources](#google-coding-interview-preparation-resources)" below.

The second most important onsite interview type at Google is system design. Again, they are allowed to ask anything they want, so don’t be scared off if you get a question you’ve never practiced before.

High-level and low-level system design questions are both likely. Some examples include:

- Design a load balancer
- Design Facebook Messenger
- Design an auth platform

Google system design interviewers also tend to design problems that include linchpin questions. These are questions where if you don’t ask about a specific aspect of the problem, you can’t really solve it. For example, an older system design question at Google asked you to set up a service in some foreign country, and in the prompt, the interviewer mentioned that you have a dependency on some third party service.

The linchpin question to ask: “What’s the service level agreement for that 3rd party service?” If you didn’t ask that (or something like it), then you wouldn’t be able to effectively reason about availability, which you’d need to do in order to do well on the question.

To avoid getting tricked, ask even more questions in Google system design rounds than you normally would.

The least important round at Google is the behavioral round. They have the easiest behavioral screen in FAANG. Plus, you might complete an onsite at Google without a behavioral round because they’re optional. It’s not clear which candidates get them and which don’t. This is another reason to not prep too hard for their behavioral round.

If you do get some behavioral questions, they might be one of the following:

- Tell me about a time when you had a colleague who was difficult to work with.
- Tell me about a time you received negative feedback.
- Tell me about a time you were mentoring a more junior engineer and your feedback wasn’t getting through to them.
- If you were going to plan an offsite for the team, how would you do it?

Google is also more likely to ask you reflective questions. Most other FAANGs stick to situational questions such as, “Tell me of a time when…”. Those situational questions ask you to describe a past circumstance or scenario you’ve actually experienced and are fairly straightforward to answer. Reflective questions, on the other hand, can be tricky because they’re asking you to reflect on, or speak to, something less concrete, e.g., “What do you think about setting goals?”

The smart way to answer a reflective question is to re-formulate it, and then answer as if it’s a situational question. So, “What do you think about setting goals” instead becomes,”Talk about a time you used goal-setting as a time management strategy”, which you can now more-easily answer by describing a real experience and outcome, “The last time I set goals…etc”, as opposed to wading into theories about personal agency. “I think goals are cool and important…” might not get high marks.

### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer

“To be honest, there was some cultural backlash at Google when they announced that we had to do these behavioral interviews. What that means is you may get an interviewer who has very little interest in conducting this type of interview. Which could go very good or very bad. I have some peers who think this should not be a part of the interview process. So they give everyone the highest marks, pretty much just to eliminate this category from the interview. Google is primarily engineers, and most of the engineers think that this is a bunch of HR BS. So they either just won’t accept any calendar invites they get or they'll just check the boxes.”

## How Google makes hiring decisions

Most of the time, the post-interview feedback process at Google is completely asynchronous, and interviewers don’t meet live to discuss hiring decisions. That’s one reason why interviewing at Google isn’t like interviewing with humans: it’s more akin to interviewing with a machine.

Each interviewer rates candidates on the following seven-point scale: Strong No-Hire, No Hire, Leaning No-Hire, On The Fence, Leaning Hire, Hire, and Strong Hire.

How this affects candidates is simple: a Strong Hire can get you an offer, but it can also buy you a second chance. If you don’t get an offer, but you get a Strong Hire from one of your interviewers, you might be offered one bonus interview round to decide whether you get an offer or not.

That said, you don’t need to get a “Strong Hire” to get a second chance. Overall, if you showed enough signal to not-fail but not enough to pass, sometimes they will ask you to do an additional round.

If you get lucky enough to get a round where you are really excelling, don’t quit while you’re ahead. Keep going. In that round, don’t just strive to win; strive for total domination.

A “Strong No-Hire” bars you from interviewing at Google for some time. Reports vary here, but one of our Google interviewers told us that if you get a Strong No-Hire, you might be frozen out for several years.

If you passed overall then you will move on to the hiring committee phase.

### Hiring committee review & team matching

Google’s hiring committee consists of four to five engineers and engineering managers who have not interviewed you, with the intent of making hiring decisions as objective as possible.

Going into the hiring committee review, your recruiter will prepare a packet that consists of your resume, any notes from the person who referred you (if you were referred), your recruiter’s notes from their call with you, and all the feedback from your interviewers, from the technical phone screen to the onsite.

#### Resume screening tip

If you’re told you’ve passed the onsite, ask if you can submit a more recent copy of your resume. Some Google recruiters will let your new resume be the only resume the Hiring Committee sees. Your resume you submitted for the online application probably wasn’t customized for Google, but what you submit to the hiring committee can be.

When the committee meets, they evaluate all the data on you holistically, and they need a consensus in order to decide to make a hire.

Other than hire/no-hire decisions, the hiring committee will also decide on leveling. Ever since COVID and the rise of remote interviewing, we’ve gotten more and more reports from users that they’re being down-leveled at Google. Apparently the rationale is that Google doesn’t feel like they get as much signal from remote interviews as they did from in-person ones, and as such, when they don’t get enough of a signal for a hire but too much good signal for a rejection: they downlevel – when you want to reduce the probability of a false positives for L5… offer L4!

Engineers who are downleveled at Google accept the lower level offer a lot of the time, especially in the current climate. In some extreme cases, we’ve seen engineering managers with 10+ YoE accept an L3 (basically a new grad) offer.

Once you get past the hiring committee, you will move on to team matching. The team matching process is a bit like speed dating. In the ideal case, your recruiter will propose a few teams that are actively looking for someone with your skills, and then you’ll meet with the hiring manager from each team to gauge cultural fit and chemistry. In order to move forward, both of you have to opt in.

That said, there are rare instances where a candidate will get past the hiring committee but then not find a team that they gel with.

“Getting five scores of ‘Leaning Hire’ is most likely to result in a ‘No Hire’ decision. I have seen many cases where the candidates got five scores of ‘Leaning Hire’, and the recruiter gave them positive feedback too, but the candidate got rejected. In these cases, every person the candidate dealt with directly (the interviewers) were positive, yet the hiring committee (the only people in the process who dealt with the candidate indirectly) rejected the candidate.”

## Google coding interview preparation resources

Here are some tips for preparing for your Google coding interview:

- Practice in teams; have someone make up a question. Then have them disguise it or plant a red herring in it (for example, purposefully have it look like Three Sum, but it isn’t Three Sum).
- Practice with someone who can change the parameters after you’ve solved the main question by saying things like “Remember that assumption X we made earlier. What would happen if we removed that assumption?”
- If you see a question online that has been marked as “Asked in a Google interview”, then it is not going to be asked in your interview, period. Google is very good at retiring questions that have been leaked.
- Practice without the aid of an editor or IDE: in a Google doc, on a whiteboard, or with pen and paper.

In addition, we’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Google content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Google interviewers, long-form solutions to common Google questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Google interviews.

A Senior Engineer’s Guide to Meta's Interview Process and Questions
===================================================================

The Meta Hiring Process and Common Questions
--------------------------------------------

1.  [Learning Center](https://interviewing.io/learn)
    
2.  [Guides](https://interviewing.io/learn#interview-guides)
    
3.  Meta’s interview process and questions

Before you interview with Meta, [read our guide on negotiating with them](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-to-negotiate-with-meta). They’ve gotten very aggressive, and if you don’t know the rules, you will fail.

Meta’s interview process and questions
--------------------------------------

Meta’s interview process consists of the following steps:

*   Call with a Meta recruiter
*   Technical phone screen (and possibly a second technical phone screen)
*   Onsite interviews

![Image 1: Meta’s interview process: recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fmeta-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)

Before we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Meta’s hiring process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.

Meta interviewers are guided by the company’s current motto: move fast. All human groups have a metaphor they operate from. Meta isn’t a family or an army. They’re a well-structured Formula 1 team; they spend a lot of effort to put safeguards in place, and then they go pedal to the metal. At Meta, speed wins.

At Meta, because the process is centralized, you cannot interview with multiple teams concurrently like you can at some other tech companies. You get one shot on goal every ~3 to 6 months, depending on performance.

“If you pass Meta’s onsite, but don’t take the offer your status of ‘passed onsite’ is valid for a year. If you don’t take their offer and then choose to re-engage within that year, tell their recruiter ‘I already passed the onsite’ and push to get steps skipped because you usually can.”

When interviewing at Meta, listen closely to the subtle clues and hints your interviewer gives you. Meta is the only FAANG where you can’t become an interviewer unless you give good hints.

Please see the previous section called [“A note about recruiter calls”](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls). Also [read our guide to negotiating with Meta](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-to-negotiate-with-meta). It starts at the recruiter call.

Meta's technical phone screen is a 45-minute coding interview that focuses on data structures and algorithms.

At the beginning of the interview, your interviewer will ask you a question or two about your resume and recent work that you've done. This portion will take 5 minutes, and how you answer these questions doesn't meaningfully factor into the interview's outcome - they are just meant to break the ice and get you talking. The part that matters is the technical portion.

After the intro portion, your interviewer will ask you two coding questions, and they expect you to get through both in 35 minutes. These questions will be LeetCode easy or medium difficulty.

Meta’s technical phone screens are conducted in [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/). If you've never used it, you may want to [play around in their sandbox](https://app.coderpad.io/sandbox?_ga=2.197732077.314108963.1684799836-1650489622.1682112501&_gl=1*ijwnf5*_ga*MTY1MDQ4OTYyMi4xNjgyMTEyNTAx*_ga_XBQ5N5CE2N*MTY4NDc5OTgzNi40LjEuMTY4NDgwMDAzMi4xNC4wLjA.) and get familiar with their environment before your real interview. One specific thing about Meta's way of using CoderPad is that during the interview, they'll have code execution turned off - if you've used it before and are accustomed to testing your code during the interview by running it, you'll need to practice not being able to.

The typical Meta onsite will consist of the following:

*   At least two coding interviews
*   Two system design OR product design interviews
*   One behavioral interview

#### Alternate Process for E6 engineers

The process for E6 engineers, as outlined in the diagram above, is slightly different. There will be a Leadership Assessment interview after the Technical Screen. In this interview, the following topics might be covered:

*   Your current role, responsibility, and scope
*   Cross-functional partnerships
*   Situations regarding conflict resolution
*   Solution skills
*   How to drive results

The onsite for E6 engineers will also be different. You should only get one coding round, one architecture round, one design round and then a behavioral round.

Types of Meta interviews and what to expect
-------------------------------------------

There are four main types of interviews you’re going to encounter when you apply for an engineering job at Meta – coding interviews, behavioral interviews, and either a system design or product design interview. Here’s what to expect during each of these rounds of interviews.

### Coding interview

Meta's process is highly standardized, so coding interview questions and themes tend to repeat. Coding questions are pre-approved, but that doesn’t mean the interviewers have no freedom.

“Meta gives you the questions to ask or modify. But they don't tell you the answers in their interviewing wiki. And they let you design the path of the question: you get to ask your own twists and turns.”

“There’s some variance with the interviewer, but usually there are 20 mins per question, and the questions are simple. They want you to get the algorithm fast, and implement the basic solution. The kind of bugs that can be acceptable are empty input, and out of scope inputs like empty array/null. But an incomplete algorithm at Meta usually doesn’t cut it. They want you to get to it and get to it quickly, and you can sacrifice making a little bit of a mess along the way.”

“I think there is a rule that during the programming interview, interviewers have to ask two questions. And the questions have to be balanced. The first is more like a juicy question testing problem solving skills and you as the interviewer can permit some bugs in the implementation. The second will be easy from the algorithmic point of view but the goal is to assess how much the candidate can write debugless code and test this code perfectly. And if a candidate fails to solve both problems, even if they somewhat shine during one problem: it will be ‘No Hire’.”

It's not that bugs are encouraged, it’s that they're the only company that's top-down directive is: sometimes, in certain rounds, bugs are okay. No other company does that. Meta relaxes the need for bug-free code so that candidates can code faster.

Finally, Meta doesn’t ask dynamic programming questions and, in fact, those questions are banned.

### System design OR product design interview

Meta hires two types (on paper) of backend engineers: System Generalists and Product Generalists. System generalists get a system design interview, and product generalists get the confusingly named product design interview (in most other contexts, product design refers to UI/UX).

Which of these interviews you get is determined by your recruiter, based on your experience. If you have worked on a lot of product features, then you get a product design interview. If you have worked on high-scale distributed systems, then you get system design.

The product design interview at Meta is similar to the system design interview but with some key differences:

*   System design focuses more on high level architecture and scale, while product design focuses more on interactions between services. For example, the expectations for API design in system design interviews is just high level arguments/data passed, whereas product design focuses more on the details, i.e., a more comprehensive list of arguments and response structure.
*   Product design focuses more on how and what data flows through the entire system, between each service.
*   Data models are weighted much higher in the product design interview than in system design. The expectation is to be more thorough and detailed.

Take a look at this video, by Meta, about the difference between these two interview types:

“Product design is less databases, more data flow, more time spent on details of the API (e.g. parameters that will pass). System design is more databases, less API details, and more about scaling.”

“Many people think Meta only asks high level system design questions like ‘Design Twitter’ or ‘Design Meta Feed.’ But that’s not the case. They also ask low level questions. In E6 or above interviews, you will most likely be asked ‘Design Redis’, or ‘Design Kafka’, or ‘Design Memcached.’ I’d even seen rare occasions where E5 candidates would be asked low-level system design questions; low-level questions are less common in rounds for E5 and below.”

“You have to ask about back of the envelope estimations. A lot of senior engineers hate to do that. I hate to do that as well. It’s a waste of time. When I do the ‘There is a rule that I have to do this. But there is no point in doing this. Let’s spend 5 minutes talking about real system design. Let’s assume we have to scale our system from 0 to Google level and therefore estimations are just a waste of time.’”

Ask your interviewer: “Do you want to spend a few minutes on estimations? I’m okay with skipping it, but if you need to see it, then let’s do it. If we skipped it, one thing that might be a more interesting conversation would be spending a few minutes on how to scale this system.’”

If you don’t know what to talk about in a E5 Meta system design round, talk about user experience. Go on about two choices you could make, then explain in depth the one preferred because it’d be a better user experience.

It’s also common for Meta interviewers to ask you to walk them through a system you’ve worked on in the past, which is known as a reverse system design interview.

### Behavioral interview

Unlike technical questions, behavioral questions at Meta are not standardized: interviewers can ask you whatever they want. Behavioral rounds are of medium/low importance at Meta; they’re less important than technical interview rounds, but they do carry some weight. For the best summary of what to expect in a Meta behavioral interview, read this [blog post by a former Meta engineering manager](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-software-engineering-behavioral-interviews-are-evaluated-meta) – in it he describes _exactly_ how behavioral interviews at Meta are evaluated and also includes a bunch of sample questions.

Here is a list of questions to get you started. Read the post to get examples of good answers (split out by the candidate’s seniority level!)

*   “What project are you most proud of and why?”
*   “Tell me about a recent day working that was really great and/or fun.”
*   “Tell me about a time when you wanted to change something that was outside of your regular scope of work.”
*   “Tell me about a time you had to make a fast decision and live with the results.”
*   “Tell me about a time when you needed to overcome external obstacles to complete a task or project.”
*   “Tell me about a time a project took longer as expected.”
*   “Tell me about a person or team who you found most challenging to work with.”
*   “Tell me about a time you disagreed with a coworker.”
*   “Tell me about a situation where two teams couldn’t agree on a path forward.”
*   “Describe a situation when you made a mistake, and what you learned from it.”
*   “Tell me about some constructive feedback you received from a manager or a peer”
*   “Tell me about a skill set that you observed in a peer or mentor that you want to develop in the next six months.”

Finally, if you are applying for E5 and above make sure to have a couple of projects that lasted longer than one quarter – if all your examples are of smaller initiatives, your interviewer may walk away with the impression that you can’t handle complex projects. Also, remember to quantify the impact that you made by sharing specific metrics.

How Meta makes hiring decisions
-------------------------------

Meta’s candidate review and feedback process is usually completely asynchronous. Sometimes, they’ll do a live debrief but it’s rare. This means there’s a low likelihood for an interviewer to “fight” for a candidate. Socially influencing interviewers won’t go very far here.

Meta is also the only FAANG that asks interviewers for a confidence score when filling out post-onsite feedback forms. As a result, the process at Meta can be more forgiving on failed rounds because a lower confidence score means a failed round carries less weight. Also, Meta is the only FAANG that directly asks interviewers about downleveling.

“Coding is used to decide ‘Should we hire this person?’ System and product design is used to decide ‘How should we level this person?’

For coding interviews, the interviewer says a binary score first: ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’. Then in the comments, they say how confident they are in that binary score. The ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’ is an official metric, but the confidence score is not.

For system/product design, the interviewer gives the ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’ first. Then they say if the candidate should be considered for another level.

So the final decision could be like: ‘No Hire’ for E5 with low confidence. ‘Hire’ for E4 with high confidence."

In cases where the hiring panel is hung, it’s possible they may request one more follow-up interview to help them get more signal.

“Interview feedback is discussed primarily by the system design and behavioral interviewers, and those are the interviewers who have the most say regarding both the hire decision and a candidate’s level. If interviewers don’t feel like they got enough signal and the candidate ends up being on the fence, the recruiter will push for an additional round. Indicative hint: If you have an additional follow-up interview, your interviewers were probably split."

“At Staff level and above, it’s a mandate that candidates can’t get hired if they don’t pass both system design rounds.”

“For E6 and above candidates, if you fail one system design round but do well in the other rounds, you can get a mulligan. They can let you retake one system design round. But the same isn’t true for behavioral: if you fail there’s no mulligan. If you fail the behavioral round, it will be ‘No Hire.’”

'Team matching, offers, and “Bootcamp”'
---------------------------------------

Meta made some changes to their process in 2023. Before, unlike at other FAANGs, you'd generally accept an offer before knowing with which team you'd end up on. Then you'd do a 6 week “Bootcamp”, where you'd be trained on Meta's engineering infrastructure and systems. After the bootcamp, there would be a 2 week team-matching period.

Now, after you finish the onsite, you jump straight to the team matching process. Team matching now happens BEFORE you get an offer, and offers are contingent on team matching completely successfully.

You'll talk with hiring managers from a number of teams to gauge fit and chemistry: we've heard that sometimes it's a handful, and sometimes it's over 10.

After your team matching conversations, your recruiter will ask you to choose a team. In order to move forward, both you and the hiring manager have to opt in.

Once you make your choice, your recruiter will officially make an offer, and you'll usually have just a few days to make your decision. We hope this will change in the future, but recently Meta has been very aggressive with both offer timelines and with negotiations - they will not negotiate unless you can share competitive offer details from another top-tier company.

One other key difference between Meta's new process and the old one is what happens during Bootcamp. Historically, Bootcamp took 6 weeks, and in addition to training new hires on Meta's engineering infrastructure and systems, there'd be a multi-week “speed dating”-esque team matching component.

Bootcamp still exists, but now it's much shorter - 2-4 weeks, and the focus is getting new engineers ramped up on generic tools. After that, new engineers will continue to ramp up on their specific teams.

The team matching process is a bit like speed dating. You meet with hiring managers to gauge fit and chemistry. In order to move forward, both of you have to opt in.

“When the market is good, you can talk to 20 different teams at the same time.”

There are exceptions – some people with niche skills may get hired for a specific team before they start Bootcamp, but they still have to do the bootcamp period, just not the team-matching part afterwards.

# [Senior Engineer's Guide To Microsoft's Interview Process and Questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft)

## The Microsoft Hiring Process and Common Questions

1. [Learning Center](https://interviewing.io/learn)
2. [Guides](https://interviewing.io/learn#interview-guides)
3. Microsoft’s interview process and questions

## Microsoft’s interview process and questions

Microsoft’s interview process consists of the following steps:

- Recruiter call (and a hiring manager call from principal engineers and above)
- Technical phone interview or Codility quiz
- Onsite interviews
- Team matching

![Microsoft’s interview process: recruiter call, technical phone screen or Codility quiz, onsite, team matching](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fmicrosoft-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)

Before we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Microsoft’s process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.

Microsoft lets you interview with different teams at the same time; if you want to maximize your chances interview with several of them simultaneously.

Microsoft’s process is mainly (though not fully!) team-dependent. That means that while you interview for a specific team, you may not necessarily be interviewing *just* with people on that team. For example, sometimes you might interview with the hiring manager for a specific team, and your other interviewers will be individual contributors from other teams.

Each team runs their own processes, which can vary quite a bit from team to team as well. Sometimes Microsoft bakes a quasi-team-matching activity into an interview process: where a candidate can meet multiple hiring managers in the same loop. Another variation is some candidates’ first round screens are with a hiring manager instead of a recruiter.

### Step 2: Technical interview (phone screen or a Codility quiz)

Microsoft’s technical phone screen is a traditional LeetCode-style coding interview, with technical questions ranging from easy to medium. Interviewers aren’t given a rubric. Some of them get training, others don’t. They have freedom to ask whatever they want and judge your technical skills however they want in this round.

If you end up getting the asynchronous [Codility](https://www.codility.com/) quiz instead, you sign on and have to answer several algorithmic questions in a short amount of time. In some ways, this is harder than the technical phone screen with the human because if you don’t pass the test cases, you get filtered out. You’re judged on several factors including: test cases, correctness, and code quality.

The onsite format can vary per org, but it typically includes the following round of interviews:

- One behavioral round of behavioral interview questions
- Two or three coding rounds
- One system design round
- One domain-specific round

## Microsoft’s interview types in detail

This is the most important round at Microsoft.

“Since most engineers at Microsoft use C#, if you can, you should use C#, Java, or Python in the technical rounds. This way, your interviewer will be able to understand your code better and may even be able to help.”

Microsoft usually asks LeetCode-style medium-difficulty questions in coding rounds. Interviewers get to pick their own coding questions, but, according to interviewers, Microsoft favors the following topics (in no particular order):

- Arrays and strings
- Linked lists
- Graphs and trees

[LeetCode’s Top Questions for Microsoft](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-microsoft-questions/) is also a helpful resource.

“Tree questions are most popular, e.g., various types of tree sum, tree traversals of certain orders, subtrees, etc.”

Dynamic programming used to basically never happen, but now it’s a little more common. When you do get dynamic programming problems, it’s usually the classic ones like coin change, stair steps, edit distance, and various types of counting problems.

Tooling for coding interviews is at the team’s discretion, but many teams use Codility.

For everything you need to prepare for Microsoft’s coding interview, check out the section called "[Microsoft coding interview preparation resources](#microsoft-coding-interview-preparation-resources)" below.

System design is tied for the second most important round at Microsoft, and it’s sometimes conducted by a hiring manager. One idiosyncratic aspect of Microsoft’s process is their penchant for asking questions about compliance-related topics.

“My Microsoft interview was insanely easy. I tried to step it up when I started being an interviewer at Microsoft. But then I realized that's how it has to be. Technical is like 25% of it. It’s not a generic FAANG interview. It’s more about three things: a) ‘How well does this candidate know this system they’re going to be working on?’, b) ‘How do they meet the exact needs we have on this team?’, and c) ‘Do they understand the little things we value? Like compliance, manipulating data, data pipelines, EU data processing, etc.’”

“Microsoft is obsessed with the details of compliance. I don’t think I have seen a system that is as set up for auditing as Microsoft. Employees are asked to log so much. There’s a centralized grid system which is built into Azure. All logs are to be routed into that. This allows for centralized log spanning and auditing. Which I have not seen anywhere else.”

Outside of compliance-related questions, here are examples of other system design questions you might encounter:

- Let's go back in time, how would you ship cargo to customers? Discuss an approach that touches on availability, latency, reliability, communication, etc.
- Let's say we are interested in palindromes and we want to store them durably whenever we come up with them. Design a system that lets you enter a new palindrome every time someone comes up with one, and allows users to check if a palindrome exists in a system.
- Assume you are a teacher and you want to test students if they know the country names correctly. You are provided a list of countries and pictures. Design a webpage + backend API that mimics a test for students to evaluate their knowledge (this would be for a full-stack role).

Tooling for system design interviews is at the team’s discretion, but many Microsoft employees use Codility Canvas or Excalidraw.

### Domain-specific round

The domain-specific round is tied for the second most important round at Microsoft. Microsoft is more likely to do these types of rounds than other FAANGs, and these rounds can feel similar to system design but involve some coding.

Usually, domain-specific rounds are customized to the domain a given team works on and dives deep into that technology. So, whatever area this team is in (cloud networking, big data, etc.), that’s what they’ll ask you about.

On some occasions, Microsoft customizes a round to the candidate’s skills. For example, if you’re a backend engineer, they might ask you to design an API or design a database. They also may ask you open ended trivia questions about the programming language you are most familiar with.

“Another thing that happens in these rounds is they’ll ask you to discuss a complicated problem you have solved at your job. It's good for candidates to prepare to discuss 2-3 projects in detail: how did they implement caching, deal with scaling issues, and so on.”

Finally, you may get a scenario question that’s commensurate with your skill set. For instance, if you’re a back-end engineer, you may get a question like, “Imagine you're in a team and we're building a credit card registration system. And it's used by different firms. How do you build the interface?”

This is the least important round at Microsoft: the lowest effort way to pass is to not blame your teammates, not show red flags, and stay positive.

Microsoft doesn’t have a specific set of traits they’re looking for. You can expect the usual questions about your strengths and weaknesses, failure, conflicts with colleagues, projects, and lessons you’ve learned from past experiences in your career.

“A lot of people struggle with ‘What are your top 2 strengths and weaknesses?’ probably because they are trying to make up an answer on the spot. Good to prep answers to typical behavioral questions in advance.”

Ultimately, they are screening for three soft skills: positivity, ownership, and communication. They want to hire friendly people who can do the work and not blame others. This is not Apple or Netflix, where they want a particular flavor of personality, or where they ask interviewers to hire candidates they’d like to befriend. It’s more neutral.

Behavioral rounds can sometimes have a coding component as well. When this happens, it might be an easy/medium-difficulty 20-min LeetCode-style problem.

## How Microsoft makes hiring decisions

Interviewers grade candidates on different scales, depending on the team.

Some orgs have an asynchronous feedback process, other orgs rely on live discussion, and still-other orgs do both. Some orgs have rubrics, and others don’t. Here’s how a rubric looks at one org:

- Junior: Has growth mindset, seeks to understand ideas
- Senior: Drives self development, models openness, failure is okay, open to different ideas
- Principal: Consistently challenges group thinking towards productive discussion

## Microsoft coding interview preparation resources

Here are a few more interview tips and resources to help you prep for a software developer or software engineer interview at Microsoft.

- Microsoft interviewers can ask whatever questions they want, yet some interviewers repeat questions, so [LeetCode’s Top Questions for Microsoft](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-microsoft-questions/) is somewhat helpful.
- Study up on the services the team you’re interviewing with uses.
- Ask your recruiter for specifics about your rounds. If you get nothing helpful, then practice practical questions, LeetCode-style questions, and domain-specific questions.

In addition, we’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Microsoft content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Microsoft interviewers, long-form solutions to common Microsoft questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Microsoft interviews.

## The Apple Hiring Process and Common Questions

## Apple's interview process and questions

Apple’s interview process consists of the following steps:

- Recruiter call OR online assessment
- Technical phone screen (if you didn’t do the online assessment)
- Onsite interview

![Apple’s interview process: recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fapple-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)

Before we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Apple’s hiring process, evaluation criteria, and interview experience.

Humans in groups act out a chosen metaphor; Apple isn’t a sports team. They’re an army. Their army is made up of people obsessed with making great products. And they look to hire people who’ve embedded Apple products into their lives. Armies reward loyalty more than sports teams. Apple also has the longest tenured employees in FAANG (we're including Microsoft with FAANG for the purposes of this guide).

Apple is decentralized and lets candidates interview with different teams concurrently; if you want to maximize your odds interview with as many teams as you have the appetite for.

“I interviewed with like 12 teams. I got 2 offers. Along the way, I told one of the Apple recruiter’s I was interviewing for another Apple team and they shrugged it off; they didn’t care.”

Apple’s interview process is more like what you might see at a startup than any other FAANG – from assigning which questions to ask to interviewer training to how hiring decisions get made. Significant inter-team variance is the norm, with each team essentially acting like a startup that’s coming up with its own way of conducting interviews.

At Apple, there’s no formal interviewer training. It’s very ad hoc. Every team is different. There is literally no process. What each of the teams does is rely on one of their very senior engineers or someone very experienced. Apple has a lot of people with long tenures, like 15 years. One of my colleagues had been there for 22 years. At Apple, the more senior you get the more the team trusts you to come up with your own questions. So what the interviewers at Apple typically do: you come up with a question that's not online, and you make sure it’s relevant to what your team is doing. Then you pitch it to your manager or tech lead. Then you run with it.

“One thing not enough candidates know about is this: there’s no such thing as an Apple interview. You apply for a team. Not the company. When people ask me “How to prepare for an Apple interview?” I say ask the recruiter. Because they usually know what types of questions are asked. The recruiter spends 30 minutes or an hour per debrief where engineers are talking about the details about the code. So if the recruiter is paying attention or is at least a little bit technical, they should have a clue whether it’s LeetCode-style questions or embedded style questions. So ask your Apple recruiter a forced-choice question like, ‘Is this interview more X or more Y?’”

“I was one of the people to come up with a take-home assignment for candidates. Which was my favorite part of the process at Apple. We were hiring people for full-stack but not just any full-stack – we wanted people who were coding in Python on the back-end and a particular framework on the front-end. We cooked up a take-home which was a scaled down version of what they’d be doing on the job: an internal tool built in those exact technologies. We gave them that take home and had them work on it for a week. Then we discussed it at the onsite where we’d live-debug it and talk about architecture. I really liked this ‘Try before you buy’ style process. Because Apple really wants you to be productive in week 2, if not at the end of week 1.”

Apple is the most likely to shock you; they’re more likely to ask you something you didn’t prepare for. Out of all the FAANGs, they’re the ones you can expect to do something unexpected, and some of their tactics can seem mercenary. Apple is the only FAANG which sometimes has a process to cut interviews short if the candidate clearly isn’t meeting the bar – if you don't perform above the bar for the first half of the interview, they’ll cancel the rest.

“If by the fourth round, the hiring manager has gotten consistent feedback that doesn’t meet the bar, then they’d end the onsite early and reject the candidate.”

Apple is not results or process oriented. They’re motivation oriented. In other words, they care more about the “Why” than the “What” or the “How”, and as such, they value behavioral interviews more than coding.

Apple employees are obsessed with privacy. It’s not just marketing lip service. When asked if “privacy” is a buzzword at Apple, our interviewers said…

“Privacy isn't just a buzzword. We are obsessed with it. To drive that part home. Because it’s so important. And as I mentioned, I was a part of a group focused on gathering user data - users here being Apple internal employees – to inform future products.

Even at Apple, when we’re just getting data from internal employees, we anonymized the data. Just to practice what we preach. Privacy is huge. Another example to illustrate that is that people get fired for torrenting music.”

“Unless you’re interviewing for a security role, very rarely. Technical people at Apple are hired to do what they do best. They have a whole army of compliance folks and lawyers to take care of that stuff. They also have an internal police force called “InfoSec”, which is the team which takes care of the secrecy stuff. Engineers are needed to do what they were hired to do: engineering.”

Please see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls”](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls) for what to expect. We do encourage you to ask your recruiter what to expect for the rest of the process because as you’ll see, there is a lot of variance from team to team.

“Ask your Apple recruiter forced choice questions with two options, such as, ‘Is this coding round more of a typical LeetCode round, or more of a domain-specific open ended deep dive into a specific technology?’”

### Step 2: Technical phone interview

Like everything else at Apple, the format and technical questions presented in Apple phone screens can vary a ton. Verify this by asking your recruiter!

Technical phone screens are coding interviews that range from 30 minutes to an hour. This tech interview may be between you and a single interviewer or sometimes a panel of interviewers. It may even be a hiring manager screen with a mix of behavioral questions and coding.

In any case, the general format is a shared coding environment where the interviewer(s) can assess your ability to utilize basic data structures and algorithms concepts. Being able to provide a solution for coding questions and quickly analyze the runtime complexity of your solution are key skills to have going into this interview.

The tooling used in Apple’s technical interview rounds depends on the team you’re interviewing with, but we’ve heard that some teams use CoderPad.

### (In some cases) Step 2.5: Take-home assignment

Some teams give candidates a take-home assignment. They can give this around the same time they schedule a phone screen. The hiring manager is usually the person to decide whether or not candidates get one.

There will be roughly six to eight in-person rounds of interviews, each of which will be with your future teammates. Each round will have least one, or possibly two, interviewers.

Note that an onsite loop with one team at Apple will look very different than an onsite loop with another.

## Apple’s interview types in detail

Interviewers can ask whatever behavioral, coding, or system design questions they want; there is no standardization for Apple interview questions. However, before an interview loop takes place, some teams will do a quick, informal assignment of what kinds of questions each interviewer is supposed to ask so that they don’t all end up asking the same things.

Moreover, Apple interviewers are untrained, and as soon as a senior engineer is hired they can start conducting interviews.

Apple’s unpredictable nature makes it so some of their interview rounds can’t be categorized into behavioral, coding, or system design. Is a philosophical question about products a behavioral question? Not really. But they might ask one in a behavioral round. Are rapid fire infrastructure-focused open-ended trivia questions more system design or coding? It depends.

For example, here’s how one Apple interviewer describes the behind-the-scenes top-down directive before an upcoming onsite. “Go find a question that would be a good one to ask for our team.” That interviewer then ran it up the chain to an engineer above them. Then, that question immediately got asked in the next interview.

At Apple, each interview loop is specific to the needs of individual hiring managers – there is no canonical “Apple interview”, and everything is “made to order” for each specific team. That makes it difficult for candidates to prepare.

Some teams at Apple prefer practical rounds. Sometimes, they’ll have you write a program on your own laptop and IDE. Other times, they’ll spend the whole round deep diving into a specific technology/use case that’s relevant for their team. For example, a team that wrote in Java and did a lot of work with concurrency had a whole round focused on concurrency in Java!

Other teams do medium-ish LeetCode-style questions.

At the end of the day, these interviews vary so widely it’s hard to give a specific directive, other than: ask your recruiter. For senior and above candidates, it’s more about demonstrating competence rather than needing to ace the question.

For everything you need to prepare for Apple’s coding interview, check out the section called "[Apple coding interview preparation resources](#apple-coding-interview-preparation-resources)" below.

Apple interviewers tend to ask questions relevant to a specific team’s work. For instance, a team focused on building web services will tend to ask questions about that, while front-end teams may ask UI-related questions. It may be good to try to get a feel for the day-to-day work from the recruiter/hiring manager, as the job descriptions are not always the most helpful (remember: privacy!).

In system design rounds, Apple interviewers love to hear about reliability. If you don’t know what else to talk about, dig into reliability.

Apple’s most important round is usually behavioral or system design. Behavioral rounds are more important than coding rounds.

“In behavioral, you gotta be a rockstar. You gotta be a leader. If you’re abrasive, or if you’re not a cultural fit, how are you going to lead the juniors? And system design is going to weigh a little more than behavioral. If you can’t code or if you’re a little rusty –if you’re good at system design and behavioral–we’ll forgive the subpar coding rounds.”

An interesting paradox at Apple is: they highly value behavioral rounds but they don’t have a standardized way to assess candidates in those interviews

“Towards the end of my career at Apple, we had a huge need for mobile developers. People who were able to do iOS apps. I was part of an R&D team. We mainly built web products in the beginning, but towards the end of my career we started doing more mobile stuff. We didn't want to hire someone who could only do mobile. We wanted someone who would be half as good at mobile stuff and half as good at web stuff, so they could plug themselves in anywhere.

If the interview process was standardized across the whole company - you can imagine how hard that would be to test specifically for the niche skill set we needed. Within two days we cooked up a whole new homework assignment just for the ios candidates, we cooked up a whole new set of interview questions. We kept the behavioral part the same. But the technical part - we flipped it over just like that. And it was really good. We changed the way we graded, we were able to filter candidates based on the new set of questions. It was just fast. We didn't get any pushback from HR. We didn't have to work with compliance. We just did it. Really fast. Really nimble.”

Because Apple doesn’t standardize their interviews, they’re particularly prone to bias. Sometimes the top down guidance to Apple interviewers is something like: “In the behavioral round, just see if you like them. See if you’d like to get a beer with them.”

“[Interviews are never standardized.] And i’ll tell you why. Apple is a very secretive company. Everything is on a need to know basis. Also, it's a hugely political place. It was good for me because I understood the game. I didn’t blame the players I played the game. For those who understand the intricacies of politics, and simply accept the fact that it will happen when you have all Type-A people being paid a tremendous amount of money to do shitty little things, it's bound to happen. You have to accept it or you’re not going to play the game. Everything at Apple is very siloed. Even when it comes down to the cost center. Everything is super independent of one another. That's actually one of the strengths and weaknesses of Apple. We double effort for sure. But that doesn't matter to Tim Cook. They have billions of dollars to afford this – not a problem. I also really liked how it was siloed because teams and their priorities change, leadership changes, a lot of things change. Being able to decouple from the greater company enabled them to become one of the biggest, if not the biggest tech company in the world.”

Even if rounds aren’t standardized, you will definitely be asked “Why Apple?”, and your answer needs to be on point. Some interviewers reject candidates solely for not having a good answer to this question. “Why Apple?” isn’t always a single question; they can spread this out into multiple questions and drill down on this for a good portion of a behavioral round. You can also expect other motivation-based (or “why”) questions.

“A common red flag is giving generic answers to the ‘Why Apple?’ questions. If I didn't feel their passion or if they’re just treating Apple as another job, that’s usually a red flag for me regardless of their technical competence. They really have to somehow convince me – and this is an emotional response they have to bring out of me – they really have to convince me they really want to work at Apple, they really want to roll up their sleeves, and they really believe in our values: delighting the customer, sweating the details. Making awesome products… We only care about that. We don't care about anything else. That emotional response has to be drawn from me and if they don’t then I’m likely to say, ‘They were good but meh.’”

“I can tell you about a great answer one candidate had for ‘Why Apple?”. He said something like… His wife and him were university students dating across two continents. This person said they shared a recent feature – I think it was like when you facetime and you can watch video in sync – he shared how that changed his life. His wife and him went through the whole international relationship because of that. That significantly helped their relationship.”

Apple wants to hire candidates whose lives have integrated with the Apple products. And the reverse is true too. It's a fatal flaw to say, “I've never used an iPhone or a Macbook or an iPad” because those people clearly haven’t integrated Apple products deeply in their lives.

Apple knows what they like, and they like their products! That doesn’t mean all you have to do is gush about the products to pass the behavioral round. It means you have to tell a genuine story which connects you and Apple products or services. Ideally, a story they will remember.

Another behavioral factor debated among Apple interviewers is whether or not they agree with the idea that Apple is “cult-ish.”

“Apple cares most about the ‘Why’. You see that rooted deeply in every apple person's DNA. ‘Why Apple?’ Right? I guess this is where people get this notion of Apple being a ‘cult-ish’ company. Much like Tesla, actually. They have a huge customer following, but you also see the same pattern with their employees. Actually, I totally subscribe to this ideology. Because you want a person you work with day in and day out to have that same passion. Sometimes you're going to have to work overtime. You're not going to get paid extra for that. Sometimes you're going to work weekends. Sometimes shit’s gonna hit the fan. You don't want to work with someone who whines about it.

Our theory is that Apple is more likely to reward employees (and candidates) who act like the leader. [If you listen to 1:00:36 - 1:02:05 in an interview with Steve Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5f8bqYYwps&t=3636), you’ll see some stark similarities to how Apple interviewers talk about the organization. In this clip, he says, “You know how many committees we have? None. We are organized like a startup.” He then describes the benefits of silos and dividing things up.

Privacy and politics are the natural consequence of a place intentionally designed to be siloed and divided up and kept separate. It’s a cost that Apple accepts because the gain is increased productivity. Put people in closed systems (teams and orgs that don’t talk to other teams and orgs) and watch them get more done. This system works like blinders on a racehorse: it keeps vision focused down the track, on the goal, minimizing peripheral distraction. That’s all they need to see and they run/work faster because of it.

One final aspect of Apple’s behavioral rounds is that they will ask you specific questions about relevant skills. For example, if a team works with big data, they will ask specifically about a time you have worked with large-scale distributed systems in the context of your answer. If you don’t have direct experience with the field, they will try to get as close as possible, like asking you for what tradeoffs you’ve made when choosing a storage system. These behavioral interview questions serve two purposes: showing you have had relevant experience in the context of what the team is hiring for and trying to get you to talk about a particular behavioral skill (e.g., leadership, conflict resolution).

## How Apple makes hiring decisions

As evidenced by the highest chaos score, Apple doesn’t do many things in hiring consistently, across the whole company. One trend is that Apple teams rely on post-interview live discussions to make hiring decisions. This varies from somewhat informal (compared to the rest of FAANG) to laughably informal.

“Post-onsite feedback for my org was 100% live discussions. At Apple I never had to write feedback. Which made me do more interviews. We made the decision on the same day. Everyone had to make a decision at the end of the day. Do an onsite, then at 5pm, we gather in a single meeting room, we do on the count of three: thumbs up, down, or in the middle. Then we talk after seeing the thumbs. And try to convince the people on the other side. If there’s less than 5 thumbs-up, then that might be an instant rejection. If there’s 6 or 7 or more thumbs up, the ‘thumbs up’ people try to convince the other side. Or in that same situation, the 3 or 4 thumbs down will try to convince the other side.”

Because of the informal decision-making process and reliance on live discussion, managing the impressions of your interviewers is more important at Apple than at other FAANG. In these decision-making meetings, if there’s dissent, they strive for consensus. The people on one side try to convince the other side. This process can last 15-30 minutes on average; all FAANG companies say interviewers fight for candidates, but Apple tends to fight more than most of them.

Because of their patterns of live-discussions and striving for consensus, Apple interviewers are more likely to fight for or against you (if your performance was on the fence) than any other FAANG, except *maybe* Netflix.

Ultimately, the hiring manager for that particular role has the most say, which means that that’s the person you should be working to impress the most.

“My manager wanted to hire this person. But he failed my interview so badly. I didn't want to argue with my manager but at the same time I didn't want to work with this person. Because we are hiring people we’d work with on a daily basis. So arguments happen a lot. And in this case, I was the only ‘no’ on the board and the candidate got rejected.”

![Affirm’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Affirm_hiring_process_f008cbaa24.png)

Affirm has a hybrid process, which means that you interview for a specific org but will have engineers involved from across the company on your panel, as well as a hiring manager from the specific org you are interviewing for.

The entire process can be completed within 2 weeks. You’ll be asked to provide 3 different times that you’re available so you can be more, or less, aggressive in how you approach it.

Affirm’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s more about prep for the hiring process than anything else. You might be asked about your interest in Affirm, and they will likely talk about the role you are applying for.

Affirm’s technical phone screen lasts about an hour and is conducted in HackerRank.

We will cover what we know of their question style in the section called “Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Affirm” [below](https://interviewing.io/affirm-interview-questions#question-types).

You can do the onsite section in one day or over two days.

- **Behavioral** (45 mins). This is with the hiring manager of the team you are interviewing with. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/affirm-interview-questions#question-behavioral).
- **Coding** (1 hour). This will be conducted in HackerRank. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/affirm-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **Second coding** (1 hour). As above.
- **System design** (1 hour). This will also be conducted in Hackerrank. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/affirm-interview-questions#question-design).

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Affirm

Affirm’s coding questions are pretty straightforward and will be familiar to anyone practicing on LeetCode. You can commonly find them online. That said, their interviewers will try to put their own spin on questions – expect some variations, but if you can solve medium LeetCode problems, you should be fine.

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Affirm interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Affirm engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

This round won’t be a completely generic system design interview. It will usually relate to Affirm’s business. Expect questions about databases, multiple layers of schema, and functional design.

You might be asked to design a system that enables transactions between two users via their bank accounts but that has certain constraints built-in e.g., they can’t transfer more than what is in their account.

Timing is important here. You won’t have enough time to go into everything in detail. Try to cover everything at a high level, and ask your interviewer which areas would be most interesting to delve into more thoroughly.

Expect the standard behavioral questions here. Questions like:

- Have you ever felt pressure at work? How did you handle it?
- When have you worked on a good team? Can you describe why it was good?
- Have you ever received criticism from leadership at work?

This round is important as it is conducted by your potential manager. You can do well in the coding rounds but still fail out if you don’t perform well in the behavioral interview.

### How Affirm Makes Hiring Decisions

All the interviewers submit their feedback, and the decision is made by the hiring manager.

# [Airbnb’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/airbnb-interview-questions)

## Airbnb's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Airbnb can expect the following process

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen (1 hour)
- Onsite (5-7 hours)
- Team matching

![Airbnb’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite, Team matching](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Airbnb_s_Company_Process_8e67ab3109.png)

Airbnb’s interview process is fully centralized, which means that everyone enters the same standardized process, and team matching happens at the end.

For most levels of engineering at Airbnb, the process and questions are the same, but your answers are graded differently depending on your level. There is also a huge emphasis on culture fit, much more so than at most other companies of their size and stage.

Airbnb’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Airbnb, and what you’re looking for moving forward. They’ll also review the specific role you’re applying for to make sure you understand the expectations and requirements.

Generally, there’s only one technical phone screen, but if your interviewer didn’t get enough signal in the first one, you may be asked to do one more. Airbnb uses [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io) to conduct technical interviews, and in these interviews you’re expected to write working code and run it – pseudocode is not allowed, and the expectation is that you’re extremely proficient in your language of choice.

The onsite at Airbnb consists of 5-7 interview rounds with the following steps:

- Coding (1-3 hours)
- System design (1 hour)
- Behavioral (1 hour)
- Culture Fit (2 hours)

As with the technical phone screen, you’ll have to write working code and run it (no pseudocode). The number of rounds is dependent on your level, so more senior engineers will have less coding interviews, but more system design.

This interview is similar to [Google’s system design interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google).

This interview will touch on your past projects, contributions, how you work in teams, and so on. The core engineering culture at Airbnb is all about making your mark and owning your impact.

#### Culture Fit

Airbnb calls these “Host interviews”, and they’re conducted by non-engineers. These interviews are very important, even if you do well on the technical portion, fail these and you won't get an offer. They'll be evaluating whether or not you’d be a good culture fit with everyone at Airbnb, and how you embody their values:

- Champion the mission
- Be a host
- Embrace the adventure
- Be a cereal entrepreneur

### Step 4: Team matching

Once you’ve passed your onsite, you can expect to speak with anywhere from 1 to 4 hiring managers. The hiring managers will try to sell you on joining their team, but will also use the time to decide if you’re ultimately a good fit for their specific org.

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Airbnb

Airbnb asks LeetCode-style questions, ranging from medium to hard difficulty.

To figure out what types of questions to expect in your Airbnb interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Airbnb interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you’re likely to encounter:

You may get low-level or high-level questions in this round. Examples include:

- Design a cache system
- Design a voting system
- Design Twitter's trending topics
- Design a load balancer
- Design Facebook Messenger
- Design an auth platform

## Common Airbnb Interview Questions

Below are common questions that interviewers from Airbnb ask on our platform. Since our data comes from mock interviews, questions may not be exactly the same as what you'd see in real interviews.

### [Reverse String](https://interviewing.io/questions/reverse-string)

[Write a program to reverse the given string.](https://interviewing.io/questions/reverse-string)

### [Find the Missing Number in an Array](https://interviewing.io/questions/find-missing-number-in-array)

[Given an unsorted array of unique integers (size n + 1) and a first array identical to the second array, missing one integer (size n), find and output the missing integer.](https://interviewing.io/questions/find-missing-number-in-array)

## How Airbnb Makes Hiring Decisions

There is a hiring committee for engineering positions at Airbnb, who will ultimately decide on leveling, but whether or not to extend the offer falls to the hiring manager. You can expect an offer to come within a week or so of successful team matching.

# [Anduril’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/anduril-interview-questions)

Published: April 2, 2025

## Anduril's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Anduril can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen AND/OR Hiring manager call (1 hour)
- Onsite (4 hours)

![Anduril’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen and/or Hiring manager call, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Anduril_interview_process_9764cd993a.png)

Anduril has a hybrid process, which means that you might interview with a specific team or you might do team matching at the end. One engineer we spoke to who recently went through the process told us:

> *They seem to tailor the interviewing process to what you say you’re interested in at the company during the early rounds, so be careful about what you say you want. Stick to what you’re good at.*

From our conversations, it seems that in certain cases you do interview for a specific role, but you could end up on multiple teams depending on how the process goes. If you are interviewing for a specific role, we were told by another engineer that you should:

> *Read up about their product and the relationship between the role and the product, they will ask questions very specific to the role and product.*

Some of the engineers we spoke with had a hiring manager call instead of a technical phone screen, and some got both. More on that below.

- They might ask you how comfortable you’d be working in the defense industry.
- LeetCode practice will help, as their coding problems are at a LeetCode medium level, although they like to add practical elements too.
- If you’re going for a role that involves robotics, you need to know robotics in detail, particularly for L5/L6 level roles. They will press you to discuss the technical aspects of robotics even if your main question is more coding or system design based.
- They don’t tend to hire for remote roles.

The entire process takes about 3-4 weeks, and we’ve heard it’s more enjoyable than the typical FAANG style interview process. From one of our users who recently interviewed with Anduril:

> *Their entire process seemed less formal than FAANG, more personable, more conversational.*

They seem to be OK to move at your speed through the process. We’ve heard it can be done in as little as two weeks but that they don’t have a problem with you slowing things down.

Andurils’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Anduril, and what you’re looking for moving forward. They’ll also sometimes ask you about your qualms, if any, about working in the defence industry.

### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen / Hiring Manager Call

Sometimes you’ll get one or both of these. It seems to depend on the role you are interviewing for.

If you get the standard technical phone screen, you can expect LeetCode medium-level questions. It will be algorithms and data structures based, but they will put it into an Anduril context, e.g., drone management. One engineer told us:

> *The question is not difficult algorithmically, but the follow-up questions in terms of how to speed and scale it up were trickier.*

If you end up getting the hiring manager call instead, the objective will be to show you are a fit for the role, technically speaking. They’ll ask questions about your resume and experience before throwing in a coding question that is practical for the role in question.

- **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/anduril-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **Second coding** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/anduril-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad or on a whiteboard if you go in person. They also sometimes use the whiteboard feature in Zoom. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/anduril-interview-questions#question-design).
- **Behavioral** (1 hour). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/anduril-interview-questions#question-behavioral).

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Anduril

This will likely be algorithms and data structures-focused but will skew more practical than typical LeetCode questions. A sample question we heard was about a collection of robots, where they had tasks to perform, and you needed to keep track of the highest priority tasks. Others involved drone management or graph manipulation

You will have two coding rounds, and they’ll be quite similar.

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Anduril. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Anduril engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

You might get a pretty industry standard question here, or it could be very practical, depending on the role you are interviewing for. Some of the standard questions we’ve heard are:

- Design Tinyurl
- Design Tetris

If you get a more practical round, it might be related to managing drones in the field, where you have to get a signal from the drone and then send it back instructions. If you get a practical question, you need to be prepared to discuss the technologies, hardware included at least at a high level. The rounds for L5/L6 roles seem to skew more practical.

The behavioral interview will be more conversational and less traditional than you might have seen at other companies. That said, it will still include the questions you’d expect in a behavioral interview. They will go over your resume and ask you about projects you’ve worked on in the past. Expect questions about the projects you’ve worked on and areas like:

- Their scale and scope
- Technical challenges and how you solved them
- Conflict that arose and how you handled it

You might also learn more about the type of projects they are working on for the team you are being matched with or interviewing for. If so you’ll have the chance to ask questions, but you’ll also be asked how you’d see yourself fit into the role.

# [Anthropic’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/anthropic-interview-questions)

Published: April 8, 2024

## Anthropic's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Anthropic can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Coding challenge (60-90 mins)
- Hiring Manager call (1 hour)
- Onsite (4 hours)

![Anthropic’s interview process: Recruiter call, Asynchronous coding challenge, Hiring manager call, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Anthropic_interview_process_81881a3598.png)

At Anthropic, you interview for one of their two orgs: Research or Applied. Your interviewers will all come from that org. There is likely some flexibility in terms of which team in that org you end up on.

- Brush up on system design
- Though Anthropic’s coding questions are algorithmic, they tend to be more practical than the verbatim LeetCode questions that many companies use
- Use a larger monitor for your coding Challenge – time is of the essence, and a laptop has limited real estate to view and write code
- They don’t give exploding offers and are very patient through the process
- They use Python, and you’ll need to be comfortable with it

The entire process takes about 3-4 weeks, and we’ve heard it’s very well thought out. From one of our users who recently interviewed with Anthropic:

> *This felt so easy and thoughtful compared to all the other companies I interviewed with. They have their shit together. Efficient, thoughtful, won’t waste your time. They move faster than expected!*

Anthropic’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Anthropic, your understanding of Anthropic’s value proposition, and what you’re looking for moving forward. They’ll also explain that they are a B Corp and cover what that means.

### Step 2: Coding Challenge

We’ve heard that this can be done live or asynchronously. Most of the people we spoke to took a 90-minute take-home assessment in CodeSignal, but Anthropic's website says you might get a 60-minute live assessment, so it seems to be role-dependent. It won’t be a LeetCode-style problem, but will still be pretty straightforward. You will be asked to complete a task that gets progressively more complex. One challenge we heard about was to implement a bank with multiple transaction types. You would have to build the core business logic for the application. We’ve heard that candidates tend to run out of time in this round, so manage your time carefully.

One engineer who took the take-home assessment told us that:

> *The screening was conducted on Code Signal, consisting of a general specification and a black-box evaluator. There were four levels. The spec would get more complicated at each level, and your code had to pass all the tests at one level to get to the next level. All in two hours.*
>
> *The verbal spec was straightforward. No special algorithmic knowledge was needed. But the spec interpretation could only be obtained by repeatedly running your code to see what test cases failed.*
>
> *Makes me think the folks who go to the next level are probably good at reading ambiguous specs and trying out theories against black-box graders.*

This is mostly a technical call and is usually split into two parts. You will be asked to talk about (1) a project you’ve completed and (2) review code examples in different programming languages. You’ll be asked to detect issues and recognize what task the code is used for.

- **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CodeSignal. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section](https://interviewing.io/anthropic-interview-questions#question-coding) below.
- **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in the drawing tool of your choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section](https://interviewing.io/anthropic-interview-questions#question-design) below.
- **Second coding (role-specific)**(1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section](https://interviewing.io/anthropic-interview-questions#question-coding) below.
- **Behavioral** (1 hour). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section](https://interviewing.io/anthropic-interview-questions#question-behavioral) below.

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Anthropic

This will likely be algorithms and data structures-focused but will skew more practical than typical LeetCode questions. A sample question we heard was about iterating over and debugging a call stack.

Most coding rounds are carried out in a shared Python environment, so you’ll need to be comfortable with the syntax and standard library. Some roles will incorporate Machine Learning elements but only in one of the coding rounds and you can pass on that if you’d like. You do not have to know anything about machine learning to interview with Anthropic as an engineer.
Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Anthropic interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Anthropic engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews.

First, here’s a list of more niche technical topics that are, in our experience, specific to Anthropic:

- Data mutation
- Concurrency

As with the other interviews, expect something practical here. It will very likely be related to an issue that Anthropic has encountered before. You might be asked to:

- Design a system that enables a GPT to handle multiple questions in a single thread
- Design a Claude chat service
- Design a banking app

This will be more conversational and less traditional than you might have seen at other companies. Expect questions about AI in areas like ethics, data protection, safety, the job market and knowledge sharing.

### How Anthropic Makes Hiring Decisions

Decisions are reached by consensus (everyone agrees to hire or no-hire), but in cases where consensus isn’t possible, the hiring manager has final say.

# [Atlassian’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/atlassian-interview-questions)

Published: June 16, 2024

## Atlassian's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Atlassian can expect the following hiring process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen (1 hour)
- Onsite (4-5 hours)

![Atlassian’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Atlassian_s_Interview_Process_f7d2fec3b4.png)

At Atlassian, the process is centralized, meaning you won’t do team matching until after the onsite phase. You’ll be interviewed by people from different teams during the interview loop.

- Their coding questions are discoverable online – they have a set bank that they use
- You can use any language for the coding rounds and your own IDE
- They have published their own [guide to the engineering hiring process](https://www.atlassian.com/company/careers/resources/interviewing/how-to-nail-your-engineering-interview)
- They hire remotely, but salaries are location-specific

The entire process takes about 4-6 weeks.

An engineer familiar with their hiring process told us that Atlassian’s “[Chaos Score](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process#the-chaos-score) is very low, i.e., there is a high level of consistency in terms of process and outcomes for different candidates.

Atlassian’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Atlassian, and how the teams you’ve worked on before have been structured. They’ll also discuss the possible roles that are available.

### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen via Karat

Atlassian uses a third-party interview service called Karat to conduct the technical screen that comes before the onsite. This seems to be true for most engineering roles but not all. If you haven’t been interviewed by Karat before, you’ll be interviewed by an engineer who does NOT work for Atlassian but who’s getting paid by Karat to conduct interviews on their behalf.

If you are interviewing for a backend or full stack engineering role, you’ll get a coding question. It will be a LeetCode-style, medium-level question selected from Atlassian’s question bank. You can find examples of the types of questions they ask online.

If you aren’t interviewing for a backend or full stack engineering role, we’ve heard that this can be a coding round OR a system design round and may be conducted by an Atlassian engineer, rather than an outsourced third party like Karat. If that ends up being the case, you will be able to use your own IDE or tooling, whatever language you’d prefer, and even any developer tools you use during your day-to-day, outside of AI technologies.

If you get a system design round, you might be asked to design something like a task list or job scheduler. You’ll be able to use any tooling you’d like to build the system. It’s really important to show how you are thinking about the problem by asking good questions, discussing tradeoffs and constraints, and mentioning both technologies and internal partners you might use to achieve your goal.

This will vary slightly by role but here’s what you can expect during the back-end and full-stack hiring loops.

- **Coding x 2** (60 mins each). These interviews will be conducted in your IDE of choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section](https://interviewing.io/atlassian-interview-questions#question-coding) below.
- **System design** (60 mins). This interview will be conducted in the drawing tool of your choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section](https://interviewing.io/atlassian-interview-questions#question-design) below.
- **Values** (45 mins). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Values section](https://interviewing.io/atlassian-interview-questions#question-values) below.
- **Manager interview** (60 mins) For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Manager interview section](https://interviewing.io/atlassian-interview-questions#question-manager) below.

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Atlassian

Atlassian has a bank of questions that they use for coding rounds, and you can find examples online. Except something that feels like a LeetCode medium-level question.

They are trying to test out how you would approach a problem if you encountered it at work, so you’re able to use the language and tooling you are comfortable with. They are assessing you based on 5 key criteria:

1. Code Quality: Clean up your code as you go and act as if it is eventually going into production.
2. Adaptability: Be prepared to be given additional requirements to incorporate as you go and be open to change when it makes sense.
3. Conceptual Thinking: Break down the problem in components and discuss it in conceptual terms before you start to solve it.
4. Decision Making: They put more focus on why you approach a problem from a certain angle than whether you solve it. Discuss the pros and cons of your decisions.
5. Resourcefulness: They want to see how you use your experience and other resources to solve problems when needed.

Be prepared to discuss how to scale your solution as well!

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Atlassian interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Atlassian engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

[Priority Queues](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions)

[Watch 3   
 interview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=priority-queues)

Again, you can use any tooling you’d like for this round. You might be asked to:

- Design a job scheduler
- Design a task list
- Design a tagging system

This is a pretty standard system design interview. You won’t need to code anything and the focus will be on how you would build the system and the tradeoffs, considerations and optimizations that might be involved.

This interview can be conducted by anyone at the company. You might talk to someone from Marketing, Sales or any other department. It will feature scenario-based behavioral questions. They prefer the STAR framework for answering questions, so brush up on that methodology. It’s a good idea to review [Atlassian’s values](https://www.atlassian.com/company/values) and incorporate them into your answers. Expect questions about how you’ve handled giving and getting feedback, how you’ve worked on teams, etc.

### Manager Interview

This is another behavioral interview, this time with an engineering manager, and it will be a deep dive into a past project you’ve worked on with a team, so be sure to prepare. The types of questions that you get here will focus on things you learned while working as part of a team and the scale and scope of your impact. They will ask questions around conflict resolution, the lessons you’ve learned, how you’ve mentored others, and how you were able to drive outcomes. Again, knowing Atlassian’s values, and incorporating them into your answers will help.

### How Atlassian Makes Hiring Decisions

Decisions are made by a hiring committee. We don’t have a lot of information on their process but we do know that they sometimes ask you to complete an additional round if you didn’t quite meet the bar during the onsite.

# [Block/Square’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/block-interview-questions)

## Square's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Block/Square (from now on we'll refer to them as Square) can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen (1 hour)
- Onsite (4-5 hours)
- Team matching

![Square’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite, Team matching](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Square_s_Company_Process_fe968457a9.png)

Square’s hiring process is a hybrid. Although you apply for a specific team from the get-go, your interviews will likely not be with the people on your team – interviewers are randomly selected from a pool – except for the hiring manager interview.

Note: Square is one of the few companies that will actually give you some constructive post-interview feedback!

The entire process takes about 6 weeks, based on our sources.

Square’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Square, and what you’re looking for moving forward. They’ll also review the specific role you’re applying for to make sure you understand the expectations and requirements.

It’s really important to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A).

Square’s technical phone screen lasts about an hour. In rare cases, they will let very senior candidates skip this step. In this interview, you’ll pair with your interviewer on a coding problem in [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io).

After this round is over, you’ll get high-level feedback about your performance from your recruiter, regardless of outcome (e.g., you might get feedback about your coding speed, your attention to detail, and so on).

The onsite at Square consists of 4-5 sessions, depending on the role and experience level of the candidate. Most of the interviews, except for the hiring manager interview and the coding rounds, are two-person panels. If you’re a mid to senior-level engineer, you can expect the onsite to look something like this:

- Coding (2 hours)
- System design (1 hour)
- (For L6+) Leadership interview (1 hour)
- Hiring manager interview (30 minutes)

Square’s onsite includes two separate 1-hour coding interviews, conducted in [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io).

This round is conducted by a two-person panel.

#### (For L6+) Leadership Interview

This round is conducted by a panel of two very senior engineers (both will be L6 and above).

#### Hiring Manager Interview

This is a call with a hiring manager from the team you’d be working on. For more junior engineers, it usually takes the form of a “Teach me something technical”. For more senior engineers, it’s usually a deep-dive into a relevant project you’ve worked on in the past.

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Square

Coding questions at Square are practical, e.g., “Build an app to split a bill with friends”, rather than LeetCode-style. Square has a question bank with approved questions that interviewers can pull from, and they can submit their own questions to it as well, though there’s a rigorous review process:

- You propose your question
- It gets approved by other interviewers
- You try out your question in the wild, and it gets shadowed as well
- Once it’s fully approved, it goes into a company-wide question bank

Interviewers are also encouraged to layer complexity in their interviews, and a question that might start out simple can go to unexpected places.

Square’s questions, while practical, may touch on the following technical topics/concepts, as you’ll need them to build whatever it is your interviewer tasks you with:

These will likely be high-level [system design questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview), and though it’s now retired, one of the more common system design questions at Square was “Design a Hotel booking system”.

## Common Square Interview Questions

Below are common questions that interviewers from Square ask on our platform. Since our data comes from mock interviews, questions may not be exactly the same as what you'd see in real interviews.

## How Square Makes Hiring Decisions

After each round, interviewers leave feedback and makes a hire or no-hire recommendation. Those are then collected and sent to the hiring manager, who will decide whether to “plead your case” in front of the Hiring Bar (Square’s version of a hiring committee).

Note that you can get mixed feedback from your interviewers and still get moved forward. It really depends on what the hiring manager needs and what they can justify.

Square’s Hiring Bar is composed of 3 people – either eng managers or senior engineers. Your hiring manager takes your resume and interview results and explains why you’d be an asset to their team. Then the Hiring Bar votes, and if you get at least 2 of the 3 votes, you get an offer.

# [Bloomberg’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/bloomberg-interview-questions)

Published: September 25, 2023

Bloomberg’s interview process is completely decentralized. Each team asks its own questions, focuses on different things, and might have slightly different processes – for instance, some teams don’t ask any system design questions.

Like many other decentralized companies (e.g., [Amazon](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)), you can apply to and interview with multiple teams simultaneously. However, all teams have access to the same applicant tracking system, so it’s possible that if you’ve done poorly with many teams already, subsequent teams may decline to interview you. From what we’ve heard, however, there’s no real downside in hedging your bets and talking to as many teams as possible.

If you do decide to interview with multiple teams, you’ll have to repeat the entire process below every time.

General tips for your Bloomberg interviews:

- Do lots of algorithms and data structures practice
- Be ready to interview in Java or C++
- Read up on what Bloomberg does before your interviews, and have a good answer for Why Bloomberg?

![Bloomberg’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Bloomberg_s_Company_Process_6b61d23f61.png)

## Bloomberg’s Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps

Bloomberg's recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Bloomberg, your understanding of Bloomberg’s value proposition, and what you’re looking for moving forward. They’ll also review the specific role you’re applying for to make sure you understand the expectations and requirements and go over the hiring process.

Bloomberg’s technical phone screen lasts about an hour and is conducted on Zoom and HackerRank. Algorithms and data structures are typically the areas of focus. Unlike at many other companies, you will not be running your code during the interview, so it’s OK if it’s not syntactically perfect, as long as it’s efficient and largely correct.

The Bloomberg hiring process is all virtual, and they break the onsite up into individual sections – once you get through the first technical phone screen, you are essentially at the onsite phase but will have to pass each interview to get to the next.

During the virtual onsite, you will use Zoom and HackerRank for all the sessions. The topics will vary team by team, so you may get system design questions or algorithms & data structures questions during the technical rounds, or a combination of both. It is possible to only get coding questions and not have to do any system design – the details vary from team to team.

- **Technical interview** (1 hour). Just like in the phone screen, you won’t have to run your code. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the “Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Bloomberg” section [below.](https://interviewing.io/bloomberg-interview-questions#question-types)
- **Technical interview** (1 hour). As above.
- **Behavioral interview** (1 hour). This will be a test of your soft skills by the HR team. Cultural fit is very important to them, so have a well-thought-out answer as to why you want to be there.
- **Final interview with a senior manager** (1 hour). This will be your final interview and it will be conducted by a senior manager, someone who manages at least 50 engineers at Bloomberg. Some of the questions may be technical, others behavioral. Details depend on both the manager and the team.

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Bloomberg

Each team has its own questions, and there is no central bank. Some teams only ask coding questions, but others will mix in system design questions. Your questions might be in C++ or Python depending on the team. Most teams at Bloomberg use C++. Senior people should know C++ going in, though Java also works. Not knowing either of these languages isn’t a deal-breaker, but it can be a tiebreaker when deciding between two candidates who did well otherwise.

As there is no central bank of questions, each team and each interviewer will pull questions from elsewhere. This could be from LeetCode, previous companies they’ve worked at, or questions they’ve seen before at Bloomberg.

Mostly, you should expect standard algorithms and data structures questions in this round. To figure out what technical topics might come up in your Bloomberg interviews, we did 2 things. First, we spoke to some current and former Bloomberg interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you’re likely to encounter.

System Design questions at Bloomberg tend to skew practical and tend to be finance-related. For instance, you might be asked questions such as: How would you design a stock exchange?. Unlike other companies, you might be asked to write code during this interview.

This will be a pretty standard behavioral interview conducted by someone from the HR team. Expect questions about your past experience and some situational scenarios, e.g., *How would you handle conflict in the office?*

It’s also very important to do your homework and read up on Bloomberg and what they do, so you can effectively answer questions about why you want to work there.

### How Bloomberg Makes Hiring Decisions

Their interviewing team will sync after each stage of the onsite process and do a debrief. This will determine whether or not you pass through. It’s possible to be sent home after any of the onsite rounds.

# [Capital One’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/capital-one-interview-questions)

## Capital One’s Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Capital One can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Online assessment (via [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com)) (1.5 hours)
- Onsite, or as they call it, a “Power Day” (3-4 hours)
- Team matching

![Capital One’s interview process: Recruiter call, Online assessment, Onsite, Team matching](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Capital_One_s_Company_Process_07d5de20b0.png)

Capital One’s process is fully centralized. This is a recent change – before that, you had to apply separately to each team. Now, everyone enters the same standardized process, and team matching happens at the end.

Once you apply, a hiring manager will review your information and coding assessment to decide if they want to invite you for the virtual onsite (aka Power Day). If there are multiple hiring managers interested, you’ll have an opportunity to chat with them after your onsite and make a choice of team.

This is a typical recruiter call, where they’ll ask about previous experience, relevant projects, and why you’re interested in Capital One. They’ll also elaborate on the role and confirm that your experience and expectations are a good match.

### Step 2: Online Assessment

Capital One’s online assessment consists of three LeetCode-style algorithms and data structure questions: one easy, one medium, and one hard, administered via CodeSignal. You get 1.5 hours to complete it.

### Step 3: Onsite aka “Power Day”

Capital One’s onsite lasts roughly 4 hours and consists of the following steps:

- Coding (1 hour)
- System design (1 hour)
- Behavioral (1 hour)
- Case study (1 hour)

This interview takes about an hour and focuses on algorithms and data structures. You’ll share your screen with the interviewer (usually over Zoom) and code in whatever environment you usually work in. Capital one’s preferred languages are JavaScript, Java, TypeScript, Python, and Go.

This is a one hour interview. The expectation here is that you’ll be able to go in-depth on your design choices and that your design needs to be as functional as possible, given the interview time allotted. One common mistake we heard about from one of our interviewers at this step is that people get hung up on trying to perfect a small piece of their solution instead of getting to an end-to-end solution that works. With that in mind, make sure that you’re able to articulate your assumptions and call out any shortcomings in your design.

This interview can either happen live, in which case it lasts one hour, or in some cases it’ll be an asynchronous online assessment. In both cases, it’s pretty standard behavioral fare – you’ll get questions with the expectation that you’ll answer using the [STAR format](https://capd.mit.edu/resources/the-star-method-for-behavioral-interviews).

In this interview, you’ll be presented with a hypothetical situation and asked to develop a solution to the underlying business problem. This interview evaluates your communication skills and business sense, as well as your ability to think logically and quantitatively. It’s important to be aware of [Capital One’s values](https://www.capitalonecareers.com/culture) and incorporate them into your responses.

### Step 4: Team Matching

Once you finish your onsite, your interviewers will submit their hire/no hire recommendations. If you were matched with only one team, you’ll be extended an offer. If you matched with multiple teams, you’ll have a brief chat with each of the hiring managers, so that you have an opportunity to decide where to go, at which point the offer will be extended officially.

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Capital One

This interview usually has two medium-difficulty LeetCode-style questions.

To figure out what types of questions to expect in your Capital One interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Capital One interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you’re likely to encounter:

The focus of this interview depends on the interviewer and your seniority. While there’s a general focus on high-level system design, some interviewers will let you choose the focus (OOD, UI, etc.). The most popular question we’ve heard about is “Design a banking system”.

## Common Capital One Interview Questions

Below are common questions that interviewers from Capital One ask on our platform. Since our data comes from mock interviews, questions may not be exactly the same as what you'd see in real interviews.

# [Coinbase’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/coinbase-interview-questions)

Published: October 1, 2023

Coinbase’s process is almost completely decentralized, with each team typically running its own hiring funnel. This means you can interview with multiple teams although they sometimes allow you to skip stages if they feel like they’d be duplicating their efforts. There doesn’t seem to be any downside to interviewing for more than one role at a time. In fact, if you end up interviewing for multiple teams, you may be able to skip steps (e.g. not have to repeat CodeSignal).

A good way to get into the process with Coinbase is to find a role you like and then track down the lead recruiter or hiring manager aligned to it on Linkedin. Recruiters will also share candidates they like with other teams if they don’t have a slot open on their specific team.

General tips for your Coinbase interviews:

- It’s OK to reach out to your recruiter or hiring manager contact to ask questions
- If you feel like there was some miscommunication during an interview, be proactive and reach out to the recruiter afterward to clear things up
- Apply for the right level and don’t be too aggressive – it’s better to secure a role at a lower level than to fail out of a higher one.

![Coinbase’’s interview process: CodeSignal assessment, Recruiter call, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/coinbase_process_flowchart_6439ce881a.png)

## Coinbase’s Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps

- CodeSignal assessment (70 minutes)
- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Onsite (3 hours)

### Step 1: CodeSignal Assessment

This is an asynchronous challenge focused on data structures and algorithms. As of the date of publication, it includes 4 questions for you to work on. The first one is usually a warm-up. The others are LeetCode medium-level.

### Step 2: Recruiter call

Coinbase’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Coinbase, your understanding of Coinbase’s value proposition, and what you’re looking for moving forward. They’ll also review the specific role you’re applying for to make sure you understand the expectations and requirements and go over the hiring process. Once you pass this stage you’ll enter the team pipeline.

The Coinbase onsite is usually done over two days and includes three, one-hour long interviews. You’ll do two technical interviews and one final call with a hiring manager. For the technical portions, you can use your own IDE with a screen-share, or they can provide tooling.

- **Technical interview** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the “Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Coinbase” section [below](https://interviewing.io/coinbase-interview-questions#question-types). You can typically use whatever language you want, although a few teams do require you to use a specific language.
- **System design interview** (1 hour). As above.
- **Interview with a hiring manager** (1 hour). As above

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Coinbase

Each team has its own questions, but there are consistencies in the type you will encounter at each stage.

This round is a “pseudo project” – you’ll be asked to build a feature, and you’ll get input data in the form of a mini database. You will have one hour to get as far as you can.

System design questions at Coinbase tend to skew practical. Many questions involve setting up microservices and then showing the network topology of your chosen architecture. Basically, they will want to test your understanding of microservice architecture but through the lens of building a product.

This will be your final interview, and it will be conducted by a hiring manager. You’ll likely be asked some culture fit/behavioral questions, but at this point, the hiring manager will also be trying to sell you on the role.

### How Coinbase Makes Hiring Decisions

Their interviewing team will all meet after the onsite and give their feedback to the hiring manager, who will make the decision. A director will then review the decision and has the power to veto, but this very rarely happens.

# [Databrick’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/databricks-interview-questions)

Published: April 22, 2025

## Databricks's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Databricks can expect the following process:

- Recruiter screen (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen (1 hour)
- Hiring manager call (1 hour)
- Onsite (spread across 4-5 hours)

![Databricks's interview process: Recruiter screen, Technical phone screen, Hiring manager call, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Databricks_interview_process_a0fc569fb6.png)

Databricks has a hybrid hiring process. Candidates are typically matched to a specific part of the organization early on, and you'll interview for a specific role, but your interviewers will not necessarily be people from your future team. There is also scope to switch roles after the onsite. According to our sources, about a quarter of candidates pivot to another team after completing their onsite interviews.

The entire process can take up to 8 weeks, making it one of the longer hiring processes in the industry. Recruiters are upfront about this timeline with candidates.

- Study LeetCode questions, particularly those tagged for Databricks in the past 3 months, as some questions come directly from this pool. You’ll get LeetCode medium and hard level questions.
- Brush up on concurrency and multithreading concepts, which are essential for one of the coding rounds.
- Practice system design on Google Docs, as it is sometimes used for the system design round.
- Be prepared for graph algorithms and optimization problems, as these appear frequently in the coding rounds.
- Have impressive references ready—they're weighted heavily in the final decision process at Databricks.

Databricks' recruiter screen lasts about 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare.. They'll ask about your previous experience, your interest in Databricks, and go over the specific role you're applying for. At this stage, your profile (resume, referral information, location preferences) begins to be shared with engineering leads for potential team matching.

The technical phone screen lasts about 1 hour with an engineer. You'll use CoderPad or a similar online IDE with runnable code. Expect LeetCode-style questions, typically medium to hard difficulty. One engineer we spoke with, who had just gone through the process, told us:

> *The question was one of the LeetCode questions for Databricks. I was able to find it by searching for the common Databricks questions from the past 3 months.*

Questions candidates have faced include a weighted paths problem (graph optimization) and the [house robber problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/), which builds in difficulty as time permits. After the technical screen, Databricks begins preliminary level mapping. For L4/L5 roles, the interview loops remain similar.

Most candidates, particularly for senior roles, will have a 1-hour call with a hiring manager for the role they have been mapped to initially. This interview is primarily behavioral, covering your background and experience, what you've worked on and enjoy working on, and questions you have about Databricks and the specific organization. If a hiring manager is unavailable, you might be interviewed by the Director of Engineering for the organization in question.

### Step 4: Onsite Interviews

At this point, candidates interview for specific teams based on their background and interests. Onsite interview loops vary slightly depending on role (ML, frontend, backend, etc.) and seniority level, but the below is generally what you'll get:

- **Coding 1: Algorithms** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad or a similar online IDE with runnable code. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/databricks-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **Coding 2:** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/databricks-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **Coding: Concurrency/Multithreading** (1 hour). This round focuses on implementing programs that leverage multithreading for efficiency. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding: Concurrency/Multithreading section below](https://interviewing.io/databricks-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **System Design** (1 hour). The system design interview is often conducted using Google Docs, which some candidates find unusual compared to whiteboarding or specialized diagramming tools. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/databricks-interview-questions#question-design).
- **Cross-functional/Behavioral** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Cross-functional/Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/databricks-interview-questions#question-behavioral).

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Databricks

Databricks' technical questions tend to lean toward the difficult side. For coding interviews, expect LeetCode hard more than medium questions.

There are usually 3 coding rounds. Two will focus on Data Structures and Algorithms, and one might focus on concurrency and multithreading. The coding rounds that include algorithm questions are LeetCode medium or hard in terms of level. An example question we heard involved IAP to CIDR (checking if IP address ranges fit into CIDR notation). Another was a variable-sized tic-tac-toe game implementation question.

Candidates report these coding rounds tend to involve tricky optimizations—you can use a brute force solution to make progress, but you should be thinking of optimizations throughout.

In the Concurrency and Multithreading coding round, you might be asked to implement an efficient logger that processes messages in a queue. This round is considered particularly challenging by most candidates. One engineer we spoke to, who is familiar with the process, told us:

> *This question wasn’t on LeetCode, but preparing by solving the LeetCode questions on concurrency and multithreading will be a huge help.*

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Databricks interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Databricks engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

Their system design questions are pretty standard, but they will expand on the initial question to dig deeper into your depth of knowledge. One example we heard involved designing a service that provides customers with the cheapest copy of a book they're searching for, which requires considering integration with different book distributors, search functionality, and purchase flows.

Be prepared to use Google Docs for these interviews rather than whiteboarding tools, which some candidates found unusual. This choice seems to be up to the individual interviewer, so don’t be caught off guard!

### Cross-Functional/Behavioral

This interview is with the hiring manager and includes standard behavioral questions about your past experiences and projects. The recruiter may brief you on the hiring manager's style beforehand. You’ll be asked about your past projects and explore areas of conflict resolution and teamwork. Expect questions like "Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a coworker" and "Describe a project you're most proud of," with deep follow-up questions on specifics.

After the onsite interviews, Databricks has a thorough evaluation process that consists of multiple layers of review.

Reference checks are an important part of the evaluation, typically involving 1 manager and 2 more senior team members. Databricks emphasizes having impressive references, as they're weighted heavily in the final decision.

Next comes the Hiring Committee review. Unlike the interview panel, this is a separate committee that reviews all aspects of your candidacy: interview feedback, background, career trajectory, and references. Our sources emphasize that the final decision is holistic, so having every aspect of your application as strong as possible is crucial.

Finally, the VP of Engineering reviews the complete candidate packet and has the final say on hiring decisions. One of our sources reported failing at this step despite positive feedback in earlier rounds, suggesting that the bar remains high throughout the entire process.

In some cases, candidates might be asked to complete an additional take-home assessment after the onsite. While this is rare, it might be used when the recruiter believes it could strengthen a candidate's application. These assessments can take around 5 hours to complete and may involve specialized problems such as database challenges.

Published: February 4, 2024

## Datadog's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Datadog can expect the following process:

- Practice algorithmic questions that lean practical in terms of the type of work Datadog does (but practicing LeetCode questions will help do well in these – many of their questions start as a LeetCode medium and then layer on complexity/get more practical)
- Prepare to answer some technical questions about your past work during the behavioral portion of the onsite.

![Datadog’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Datadog_Interview_Process_db7ec1616e.png)

At Datadog, the process is centralized, which means that you won’t do team matching until after the onsite phase. You’ll be interviewed by people from different teams during the interview loop.

The entire process takes about 6 weeks, and we’ve heard it can seem quite slow at times. You might have to push to speed things up.

Datadog’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Datadog, and what you’re looking for moving forward.

Datadog’s technical phone screen lasts about an hour and is conducted in CoderPad. You will get two questions in this interview.
We will cover what we know of their question style in the section called [“Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Datadog” below](https://interviewing.io/datadog-interview-questions#question-types).

Onsite interview loops can vary slightly depending on the role and seniority, but the below is generally what you’ll get.

- **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/datadog-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **[Only for roles below Staff] Second coding** (1 hour). As above.
- **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in your choice of tool (many candidates choose Excalidraw). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/datadog-interview-questions#question-design).
- **Behavioral** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted by a hiring manager or director of engineering. It may feature some technical questions! For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/datadog-interview-questions#question-behavioral) .
- **[For Staff level roles and above] Presentation** (1 hour). This will replace one of the coding rounds. You will be asked to present a project you’ve worked on in the past to a panel. You’ll be expected to justify the technical decisions involved and explain the business context or rationale for what you did. If you do this interview, you may have to pick teams you're interested in beforehand so people from those teams can attend.

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Datadog

From the first technical phone screen through to the onsite coding rounds, you should expect algorithmic questions but likely NOT questions taken verbatim from LeetCode – Datadog has their own internal question bank. We’ve heard that the questions are a hybrid between practical and LeetCode-style. They might start with something similar to what you can find on LeetCode but then layer on additional complexity. Datadog themselves recommend practicing medium-level LeetCode questions. You might be asked questions like these:

- Bucketing numbers given specific requirements
- Given a root directory, find the total size of all the files across all sub-directories
- Given an interface and a file class, build a buffered file writer

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Datadog interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Datadog engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

We’ve heard that this round is less broad than it can be at other companies. You won’t be asked to “Design Twitter”, for example. Instead, you might get a question such as, “Given a service that returns flight deals for the last 7 days, design a system that surfaces relevant flight data to a user and notifies the user when there’s a new flight that matches their criteria.”

As one of our users said:

> *"[I] didn’t have to go into detail in every area. They kept it very high level, and the interview felt fair.”*

While it might be a fair interview, it’s also used for leveling so make sure to brush up on system design. We’ve heard of candidates being down-leveled for less-than-flawless performance here.

This interview will be with someone in a leadership role at the company, possibly a director. It will contain some standard behavioral questions but also some technical questions about your past work.

You might be asked to show a simple design of something you built at a previous company. The interviewer will want to know why certain design choices were made so they can understand your impact on the project and your level of experience working within teams.

### How Datadog Makes Hiring Decisions

After a successful onsite, a Hiring Committee will decide if you should be hired.

If they want to make an offer, your profile will be shared with multiple hiring managers for team matching. You’ll get a chance to meet a few people from the team including the hiring manager. This is more about you figuring out a good fit than being a continuation of the interview process.

# [DoorDash’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/doordash-interview-questions)

Published: December 12, 2023

## DoorDash's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at DoorDash can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Hiring manager screen (1 hour)
- Technical phone screen (1 hour)
- Onsite (4-5 hours)

- Have STAR-style behavioral answers prepared because behavioral interviews are used for leveling
- Polish up on system design. Along with behavioral, it’s what determines your level, and the bar is high.

![Recruiter call, Hiring Manager screen, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Door_Dash_Interview_Process_64864553b9.png)

At DoorDash, the process has recently moved from centralized to decentralized. This means that the interview process will vary from team to team somewhat. You apply and interview for a specific role, and the hiring manager for that role will be part of your loop. You can interview for up to 3 roles at a time and will encounter interviewers from across the organization in most scenarios.

The entire process takes about 3-4 weeks but can be completed in as little as 2 weeks, according to our sources.

DoorDash’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in DoorDash, your understanding of DoorDash’s value proposition, and what you’re looking for moving forward. They’ll also review the specific role you’re applying for to make sure your skill set matches the requirements. After this call, the recruiter will circulate your resume and specific hiring managers will have the opportunity to pick it up and request to interview you.

### Step 2: Hiring Manager Screen

This interview will be with the hiring manager for the team you applied to. They will ask you to do a deep dive into a previous project.

This is a pretty standard technical screen and normally gets conducted in CodePair (HackerRank). Our sources tell us that LeetCode medium questions are pretty typical in this round.

At this point, candidates are split into different loops depending on the role they are interviewing for, e.g., infrastructure, frontend, backend etc. Onsite interview loops vary slightly depending on the role and seniority, but the below is generally what you’ll get:

- **Two coding rounds** (1 hour each). These rounds usually take place in CodePair (HackerRank). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/doordash-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **System design** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/doordash-interview-questions#question-design).
- **Behavioral** (1 hour). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/doordash-interview-questions#question-behavioral).

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at DoorDash

DoorDash has shifted its process from a centralized one to a decentralized one pretty recently, so there is some variation in terms of the style of question you will encounter. That said, the engineers we’ve spoken to say it’s still pretty standard fare across the board, so practicing medium-level LeetCode questions will help.

This interview will be less algorithms and data structures heavy and will look to test your ability to write code fast and refactor quickly. You won’t be asked to use any specific programming language. Most questions should be practical in nature, and LeetCode questions that focus on job scheduling are popular.

From one of our users, who was a DoorDash interviewer:

> *Some questions are very practical, but it depends on the interviewer. Some love very specific LeetCode-style graph questions.*

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in DoorDash interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former DoorDash engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

This round focuses mostly on large systems and will involve designing an entire service or app with scalability, reliability, and usability concerns in mind. Expect a vague problem with ill-defined boundaries. Your focus should be on not getting lost in one area. Ask your interviewer what area you should hone in on.

They use this round for leveling, and senior candidates should be able to call out all requirements and considerations. They aren’t looking for a full solution here, so don’t get lost in the details. Cover all bases and concerns.

This round varies by role but is usually with the hiring manager for your team. It is a behavioral interview, but the hiring manager will also try to close you. You could pass all the other rounds and not do well here but still get an offer. Expect to answer questions about past experiences.

### How DoorDash Makes Hiring Decisions

The entire onsite panel submits written feedback after the interviews are completed, and then they have a roundtable meeting to discuss both hire/no-hire and leveling. Most of the time, decisions are reached by consensus (everyone agrees to hire or no-hire), but in cases where consensus isn’t possible, the hiring manager has final say. Our sources say that it is rare for a hiring manager to veto a hire.

# [Figma’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/figma-interview-questions)

Published: April 9, 2025

## Figma's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4-5 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Figma can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Hiring manager call (45 mins)
- Technical phone screen (1 hour)
- Onsite (4 hours)
- Additional “Executive Screen” for Staff-level engineers (1 hour)

Staff-level engineers (or even Seniors on the cusp of Staff) can sometimes get an additional round after the onsite. This is an executive screen, which is essentially a behavioral interview with the director of the team you are interviewing for.

![Figma’s interview process: Recruiter call, Hiring manager call, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Figma_s_Company_Process_df7aa4a2c0.png)

Figma’s hiring process is a hybrid. Although you apply for a specific team from the get-go, your interviews will likely not be with the people on your team – interviewers are randomly selected from a pool – except for the hiring manager interview and the executive screening (if applicable).

- You’ll get [a guide to Figma’s hiring process](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4tdq51dnc2ykp347vmphy/Public-General-Candidate-Prep-Doc.pdf?rlkey=mfucvg5hiava8x2xpuz24tiwh&e=4&dl=0) that includes a lot of useful information
- Their interview process is language-agnostic
- Brush up on general algorithms and data structures, but be prepared for them to use Figma terminology when they pose the questions
- They say you can only apply to one role at a time, so pick wisely
- Try to get a referral; it’s hard to get into the process otherwise
- Learn as much as you can about Figma’s architecture
- Express why you like the product and why you want to join–they are on the path to IPO and getting a lot of high-quality applicants

The entire process takes about 3-4 weeks, but we heard they can move faster if needed.

Figma’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Figma, your understanding of Figma’s value proposition, and what you’re looking for moving forward.

This is a pretty standard behavioral call with the hiring manager of the team you are interviewing for. Expect some questions about your background and experience but also some information about the team and what they are working on. You’ll get time to ask your own questions too.

This interview is scheduled as a block with the hiring manager call above and will be conducted in CoderPad. The questions will be algorithmic, but they will be set in a Figma context. In other words, they might pose a problem they run into at Figma and ask how you’d solve it with code, or ask you a very standard algorithmic question, but layer in some Figma terminology. It’s a good idea to brush up on Figma’s names for the various components they use. [You can find information here](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-components-in-Figma). Expect about a medium in terms of LeetCode-level.

- **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/figma-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in Figma. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/figma-interview-questions#question-design).
- **Second system design** (1 hour) This interview will be conducted in Figma. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/figma-interview-questions#question-design).
- **Behavioral** (1 hour). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/figma-interview-questions#question-behavioral).
- **Project deep dive** (1 hour) For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Project Deep Dive section below](https://interviewing.io/figma-interview-questions#question-deep-dive).

### [Staff-level or Close to It] Step 5: Executive Screen

If you’re interviewing for a Staff level role, or quite senior and on the cusp of Staff, they will do one more round after the onsite. It is a behavioral round with a Director. They might tell you this is a casual chat, but one engineer said:

> *The Director clearly used all the feedback given during the onsite and intentionally drilled into areas that were outside of what I’d covered before. This was very intense!*

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Figma

This will likely be algorithms and data structures-focused but will skew more practical than typical LeetCode questions. Expect about a LeetCode-medium level of difficulty. An engineer we spoke called described them as

> *Pretty standard algorithms and data structures questions, but they are all Figma-flavored.*

Sample questions include:

- Implement a Figma doc with layers, properties, class definitions, and ways to update
- Print out objects on a 2D canvas in a sequential order, left to right and top to bottom

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Figma interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Figma engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

You will get two system design rounds:

1. Relating to [Figma components](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-components-in-Figma) and how to design a feature around them
2. Another that is more focused on your specific role

They will send you a public guide to Figma components to help with the first system design round, so brush up on that. Components are like classes in Figma. The second round will lean more towards the type of work you will be doing, e.g., back-end or front-end.

As with the coding interviews, expect something practical here. It will very likely be related to an issue that Figma has encountered before. You might be asked to design a poll system within Figma that can handle multiple concurrent users. Expect to be asked about scaling and storage options.

This interview will be conducted by a hiring manager from within the same organization but not the team you are interviewing for. It’s going to be pretty standard, with questions about:

- How you’ve handled feedback in the past
- How you approach conflict
- Past projects you’re proud of

### Project Deep Dive

For this interview, you’ll be asked to prepare a few slides on a previous technical project you’ve worked on. It’s a pretty interactive session where they’ll dig into:

- The scale and scope of your role on the project
- The technical details of the project
- What issues you ran into
- What tradeoffs were made
- What you’d do differently

Unlike some project deep dives we’ve come across, this will likely be with only one interviewer.

### Executive Screen

All we can say is that this is a behavioral round. It’s hard to say what the Director will ask during this session, but they will be looking for any areas left unturned during the onsite and drilling into them.


A Senior Engineer’s Guide to Amazon's Interview Process and Questions
=====================================================================

The Amazon Hiring Process and Common Questions
----------------------------------------------

1.   [Learning Center](https://interviewing.io/learn) 
2.   [Guides](https://interviewing.io/learn#interview-guides) 
3.   Amazon's interview process and questions

All human organizations operate as a metaphor. Amazon isn’t a sports team or a family; they’re a motley crew of Terminators. They’re a different breed with notoriously high standards. They reward aggression. And they want to take over the market (or the earth, depending on who you ask)...

Amazon’s process is not centralized, and you can interview with multiple teams concurrently. To up your odds, interview with as many teams as you have the appetite for.

Amazon really loves their [Leadership Principles (LPs)](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles). Amazon interviewers may sandwich LP questions anywhere and everywhere throughout your interview rounds: coding rounds, system design rounds, all rounds. In short, at an Amazon interview, be prepared for Leadership Principles questions anywhere, anytime.

Finally, Amazon has one of the more-structured interviewing cultures. They’re the only FAANG where interviewers exist in a formal hierarchy, and Amazon openly encourages and rewards interviewers who reach the top rung in that hierarchy.

In this guide we’ve compiled a comprehensive Amazon job interview prep guide based on in-depth discussions with Amazon interviewers and interviewees. Our guide includes a detailed walkthrough of the interview process, common questions and solutions, interview tips, video replays of mock Amazon interviews, and more.

An overview of Amazon's interview process and questions
-------------------------------------------------------

Amazon’s interview process consists of the following steps:

*   Recruiter call OR online assessment
*   Technical phone screen (if you didn’t do the online assessment)
*   Onsite

We walk through each of these steps in detail below.

![Image 1: Amazon’s interview process: online assessment or recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Famazon-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Step 1: Online assessment or recruiter call

Whether you start with an online assessment or an Amazon recruiter call depends on a few factors:

*   Are you a mid-to-senior engineer?
*   Have you previously interviewed at Amazon?
*   Have you previously worked at a FAANG?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you will likely not have to do an online assessment, and your first step will be a recruiter call. That said, we’ve gotten some conflicting reports from Amazonians, and it may be that Amazon has more recently started using online assessments to test the competencies of more senior engineers as well.

If you do the online assessment, here’s how it works. It’s a timed, asynchronous test consisting of several coding problems, conducted via [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). These are usually data structures and algorithm problems of easy to medium-level difficulty, as well as some multiple choice system design questions where you have to select the design option that’s ideal in a given situation. If you do well in the online assessment, you can skip the second step, which is the technical phone screen.

If you end up skipping the online assessment, the first step in your process will be a recruiter call. Please see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls.”](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)

Amazon’s technical phone interview is a coding interview that tends to focus exclusively on data structures and algorithms. Despite the focus on speed, [Amazon interview questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon) may require a lot of code, and the time allowed is usually 30-40 minutes, which means you’ll usually get one question, as opposed to Facebook, where you might get multiple questions.

For these screens, Amazon uses an internal tool called Livecode, which has syntax highlighting for popular languages but does NOT have the ability to run the code. In fact, no code is ever compiled or run in Amazon technical interviews.

Finally, there’s a 50% chance that your interviewer will throw in 1 or 2 Leadership Principles questions into the phone screen. They’re not guaranteed, but they’ll definitely come up during the onsite.

There’s some variance, but the typical Amazon onsite, or in-person interview, for technical roles, will consist of:

*   At least one behavioral round (this doesn’t include all the Leadership Principles questions peppered through the other interviews)
*   Three coding rounds 
*   One system design round 
*   One hiring manager round

Amazon has a special type of interviewer that they include in onsite loops: the Bar Raiser. These are typically senior-level Amazon employees at the top of the formal interviewer hierarchy, and they’re the toughest and most-trained interviewers at Amazon. They serve as an independent and objective evaluator, asking follow-up questions, and ensuring that hiring decisions are not influenced solely by the candidate's immediate team or department.

“Being a Bar Raiser makes an impact on your promotion packet. Every L5 nearing promotion at Amazon, is encouraged to do the Bar Raiser training. It’s a big input to get to L6 or L7. Part of the promotion packet is: how are you demonstrating some of the Leadership Principles. And “Hire and Develop the Best” is one of the LPs. There’s a lot of work to do in hiring to become a Bar Raiser: you have to do a lot of training and a ton of interviews. Being a Bar Raiser carries a lot of weight at Amazon if you want to get promoted.”

At Amazon, Bar Raisers and hiring managers are the only interviewers who have the formal authority to veto a hiring decision. You can recognize them because they are the only interviewer in your onsite loop who has nothing to do with the team you’re interviewing for. Bar Raiser rounds can be super intense, but don’t shrink when you feel a Bar Raiser throw flames your way; embrace the fire.

The three types of Amazon interview
-----------------------------------

There are three main types of interviews you’ll face as a software engineer interviewing at Amazon. These are coding, behavioral, and system design interviews.

### 1. Coding interview

You will have to do coding interviews in the phone screen and in the onsite. Coding rounds at the onsite are very similar to technical phone screen rounds, except that in the technical phone screen you _might_ get Leadership Principles questions, whereas in the onsite coding portion, you definitely _will_.

Amazon asks mostly medium-difficulty LeetCode-style coding questions and avoids hard questions. The idea is to let candidates demonstrate how quickly they get to the optimal result, all in the service of hiring engineers who can churn out new features quickly.

Despite the focus on speed, Amazon questions may be a complex problem that requires a lot of code, and the time allowed is usually 30-40 minutes, which means you’ll usually get one question, as opposed to Facebook, where you might get multiple questions.

Amazon’s coding rounds test the following technical skills:

1.   Computer science fundamentals and knowledge of data structures and algorithms
2.   The ability to write logical and maintainable code. These rounds require writing some classes and implementing some functions, e.g., “Implement some common functions of a file system”

Although your performance in technical interviews matters (if you fail the technical, you usually will not move forward), it’s not as important as the outcome of the behavioral interview, and coding interviews during the onsite at Amazon actually feature Leadership Principles questions.

#### Anecdote from a Amazon Interviewer

“Because no code is ever run on an editor, the approach, speed, and testing are most important. Code syntax, typos, variable naming, and edge cases are less important.”

Graph questions are among the most popular types of questions asked at Amazon, as well as tree questions that require BFS or DFS. Classic questions like LRU cache, meeting rooms, word break, word search, word ladder, and so on may also come up.

We’ve heard from Amazon interviewers that _all_ of the data structures and algorithms questions in Amazon’s official question bank are actually on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-amazon-questions/). That said, Amazon interviewers are allowed to ask whatever they want in coding rounds, and some will deviate from the question bank to ask more practical questions such as, “Implement a function with some behavior with the help of these two APIs…””

Finally, like Facebook, Amazon shies away from dynamic programming questions (though they’re not banned outright).

For everything you need to prepare for Amazon’s coding interview, check out the section called "[Amazon coding interview preparation resources](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon#amazon-coding-interview-preparation-resources)" below.

### 2. Behavioral interview

The behavioral interview is one of, along with coding interviews at the onsite, the most important in terms of leading to an offer.

“I’ve done over a hundred interviews at Amazon. The behavioral interview is most likely to get someone pushed over the line if they were borderline in their technical interviews. The opposite is not true: if they don’t meet the behavioral bar, we don’t care how they did in technicals, we aren’t hiring them.”

Behavioral is an extremely important part of the Amazon interview process – Amazon is more likely to downlevel or reject you solely based on behavioral – and their behavioral round might be the most well-thought-out interview in all of big tech. It also might be the easiest to fail if you don’t specifically prepare for it. There’s no flavor like the flavor of an Amazonian behavioral interviewer; if you’ve never encountered it before and don’t expect it, it can be jarring.

One of the most common mistakes our users make is not taking this interview seriously because at most other companies, behavioral interviews tend to be more lip service than a meaningful part of the process. The bottom line is, if you want an Amazon job at a senior level or above, you have to seriously prepare for the behavioral interview questions.

Not all Leadership Principles are created equal. Customer Obsession is the 👑one Leadership Principle to rule them all. When in doubt, demonstrate Customer Obsession. If you get a curveball, give an answer that shows you’re deeply committed to making things customers love.

“If you have a bad LP round, or if LPs are problematic in the debrief, it’s almost always a ‘no hire.’ But if you have great LPs then there is a conversation where we try to see if the candidate can be hired even if the technical rounds weren't at the bar. But not the other way around. But if there’s anything ‘at the bar’ or ‘below the bar’ for LP, then you fail.”

“If a candidate does not do that well on the technical round but they do well on LPs, there is always a possibility of recycling the candidate because they’re a good fit for Amazon but not good for the team. So sometimes we’ll help them interview with other teams, and they don’t have to do a full onsite: they just need to do 1-2 more rounds as a follow up. But if they’re below the bar for LPs, then they’re not a fit for Amazon so Amazon wouldn’t help set them up to other teams with shortened onsites.”

In this round, expect questions from all 5 of these categories:

1.   Technical problem solving
2.   Learning (and failure)
3.   Getting stuff (for the business) done
4.   Interpersonal conflict
5.   Ambiguity

Honestly, the best place to find a detailed question list for Amazon’s behavioral interview, as well as a bunch of other interview preparation resources, is our [Senior Engineer's Guide to the Amazon Leadership Principles Interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles).

### 3. System design interview

System design and coding aren’t the be-all and end-all at Amazon – of course, you still have to pass them, but if your performance is borderline, doing well on behavioral Leadership Principles questions will take you over the finish line. In fact, interviewers will likely ask you 1-2 Leadership Principles questions in your system design interviews. Try to be efficient when answering LP questions in system design rounds. LPs come first. Finish them early so that you have more time for the technical question.

#### Anecdote from an Amazon Interviewer

“In many debriefs, I hear the hiring manager say that we can extend the L5 offer with the understanding that system design is not their strength, but it's coachable. At the L6 level, the system design bar is comparable to Facebook or Google.”

If you’re in a system design round at Amazon, and you don’t know what to talk about, talk about performance. They want Amazon to be the number one customer of AWS. And they love to find engineers who understand and are passionate about fine tuning performance in the cloud.

Amazon is more likely to ask you practical system design questions. For example, if you’re interviewing with a team who controls Amazon’s inventory management, they might ask you to design a piece of an inventory management system.

Other common system design questions include:

*   Design autocomplete
*   Design file upload/download to the cloud
*   Design search

The design questions are most likely about designing well-known features, as opposed to a complete system from scratch like Design Facebook or Twitter.

Amazon interviewers are allowed to ask whatever they want in system design, but a lot of interviewers fall back on reusing questions from Amazon’s question bank.

For tooling in system design interviews, candidates can usually choose any type of drawing tool. [Excalidraw](https://app.excalidraw.com/) is most popular, followed by [Miro](https://miro.com/).

How Amazon makes hiring decisions
---------------------------------

Amazon has one of the more well-structured decision-making processes in tech: teams typically do a pre-brief (live meeting before the onsite), submit asynchronous feedback, and also do a debrief (live meeting after the onsite). They rely heavily on live discussion to make decisions. Notably, though some interviewers might be able to tell an outlier story of a time a regular interviewer out-argued a Bar Raiser, most of the time the interviewers go along with what the Bar Raiser says.

Amazon interviewer’s grade on a 5-point scale: Strongly Inclined, Inclined, Neutral, Not Inclined, Strongly Not Inclined.

The two most important interviewers at the onsite are the Bar Raiser and the hiring manager. At Amazon, all of the other team members involved in the interview could vote to hire, but if the Bar Raiser _or_ the hiring manager aren’t on board, that candidate is likely getting rejected.

At Amazon, identify the Bar Raiser (the only person whose work has nothing to do with the team for which you’re interviewing) and the hiring manager (if you don’t know who it is, ask the recruiter before the onsite or an interviewer if during the onsite). Most of your energy should go towards impressing these two people – since Amazon relies so heavily on live discussions to make hiring decisions, impression management is more impactful here.

A Senior Engineer’s Guide to Netflix's Interview Process and Questions
======================================================================

The Netflix Hiring Process and Common Questions
-----------------------------------------------

2.   [Guides](https://interviewing.io/learn#interview-guides) 
3.   Netflix’s interview process and questions

Netflix’s interview process and questions
-----------------------------------------

Netflix’s interview process consists of the following steps:

*   Recruiter call
*   Hiring manager screen
*   Technical phone interview
*   A very long onsite

![Image 1: Netflix’s interview process: recruiter call, hiring manager screen, technical phone screen, onsite](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fnetflix-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)

Before we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Netflix’s process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.

Every human organization views themselves as a metaphor; Netflix doesn’t view themselves as a family like some other tech companies, they view themselves as a high-caliber sports team (in fact, Netflix calls their employees a “dream team”). They explain this metaphor themselves in their infamous culture memo.

Finally, Netflix’s interview process is decentralized and team-dependent. Moreover, you can interview with multiple teams at Netflix concurrently, which can help you increase your odds of securing a job offer.

Please see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls”](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)

### Step 2: Hiring manager screen

This is a 30 minute call. A former Netflix employee called this round “Very chill, especially compared to the onsite.” This round consists of bidirectional surface-level questions.

The hiring manager will also be selling you on Netflix. Hiring managers doing selling is business as usual, but in this case, it serves an additional purpose – because their onsite is by far the most intense, they have to sell harder upfront because the onsite is a bigger commitment for the candidates.

### Step 3: Technical phone screen

The Netflix technical phone screen is a coding interview that typically lasts 45-60 minutes. There is significant inter-team variation on what these interviews cover, and the tooling you use during these interviews also varies by team,

Onsite interview structure varies from team to team, but you’ll have roughly 8 interviews focused primarily on system design, then behavioral, and then coding.

Depending on the length of the onsite, Netflix recruiting may ask you if you’d prefer to split the onsite over two days, and we recommend that you proactively ask to do that, given how taxing the behavioral and system design portions are!

Netflix is the only FAANG that routinely includes 1-2 directors in their onsite loops. If your loop has two, it’ll be one director will be from your org and another from a partner org. Netflix does this to reduce bias. One director may do a system design interview, and the other will do a behavioral interview.

“Don’t be thrown off by having to talk to directors. Just stick to the principles: when you speak about technical stuff you’ve worked on, focus on scale, availability, and security. When you speak about behavioral stuff: use shared ideas from their culture deck, take accountability for your wins and failures, and demonstrate metrics and impact.”

“The HRBP [which is basically a very senior recruiting function] and the director would typically focus on behavioral rounds. I have also seen directors spending time (30 mins) just letting candidates ask and clarify any questions that they might have regarding the team, Netflix culture, career growth path or any other aspects. So, a strong recommendation would be to be ready with your genuine questions list and get things clarified in such interviews. Candid conversation is one of the key values at Netflix and asking genuine concerns if any is seen through good lenses, as that establishes candidates' seriousness about the role to some extent.”

Netflix’s interview types in detail
-----------------------------------

The technical questions Netflix asks vary from team to team. Some teams don’t ask LeetCode questions. Other teams will ask medium-difficulty LeetCode-style coding questions with a creative/practical twist.

These rounds are going to change team by team, but the pattern we’ve noticed is that Netflix coding questions often come in two parts.

Typically there is one question and, in scenarios where edge cases and tests are done early, say within 45 minutes, the interviewer may choose to spend some time discussing general large scale engineering concepts and distributed systems (like microservices, scalability, etc.). For instance, some expansions could be:

*   A system design expansion on top of the coding question, such as a practical application where they ask you to apply the solution you just found to a part of their real-life system
*   A deep dive into a specific skill set (e.g., if this team codes in Java: they’ll have a round all about multithreading for Java specifically) 
*   For everything you need to prepare for Netflix’s coding interview, check out the section called "[Netflix coding interview preparation resources](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/netflix#netflix-coding-interview-preparation-resources)" below.

This is the most important round at Netflix. Coding carries the least weight, behavioral carries a lot, and system design has the most.

Netflix system design rounds are highly unique and highly challenging. Netflix is to system design as Google is to coding; these technical interview rounds include the most difficult and bespoke questions.

Similar to how Amazon loves Leadership Principles, Netflix loves system design so much they even throw it into coding rounds sometimes – first, you solve a LeetCode-style problem. Then they ask you to apply it to a real-world use case.

That said, Netflix system design rounds are easier to prepare for if you know the patterns: Netflix loves scale. Netflix never wants to go down, and Netflix hates when things aren’t secure. Availability is super important to them; they want to ask and hear about tactics to scale systems, keep systems highly available, and maintain secure systems.

At Netflix, you’re likely to see unique questions that you won’t get anywhere else, and the system design round is the part of the process that Netflix interviewers take the most pride in, so they make up hard, one-of-a-kind questions from scratch. Thematically, their questions are more likely to be focused on scaling. They also like to ask about security and availability.

In fact, Netflix is more likely than the rest of FAANG to give you a system design round focused solely on security. For instance, you might get asked what you would do during a DDoS attack, and the entirety of the session will be spent drilling down into the details. And because they’re also obsessed with availability, you might get questions around backups and what to do if a service goes down.

Moreover, as with their coding rounds, Netflix prefers questions with a practical application, and they’re likely to ask you about something they’re working on right now. If you research the hell out of their architecture – specifically the service that particular team is in charge of – and the other services this service interacts with, you’ll be in good shape.

You’re also likely to see a “reverse system design” round, where your interviewer will ask you pointed questions about the systems you’ve worked on before, e.g., the largest scale system you’ve worked on, how did you manage it, how did you scale it, etc.

Questions they most likely _won’t_ ask are product-focused questions, such as “Design Spotify”.

Learn about Netflix’s overall architecture so you can a) speak their language, and b) build or speak of something similar (in the interview) that Netflix has already built but simpler.

For the team you interview with: what’s their tech stack? What open source stuff do they do? With which other services might their service interact? That last question is most critical. If you can put forethought into how their current system works, you’ll have a huge leg up; then all you’ll need to do is discuss what you learned about their system to score a bunch of points with any of their interviewers.

What tooling you use in these interviews depends on the team you’re interviewing with.

Answers to behavioral questions are almost as important as system design at Netflix. You’ll get rejected if you fail the behavioral screen.

These interviews have a heavy emphasis on the candidate being a cultural fit, being able to work in a team, having curiosity, and being product minded, highly motivated individuals capable of driving products forward.

A unique part of Netflix’s behavioral interview is the “Dream Team” interview. This is a slightly more intense behavioral round conducted by a director. The "volume" is turned up on all of the things you might see in a typical behavioral round at Netflix (scale, accountability, open communication about concerns, high risk and high reward.)

“Netflix doesn’t hire as much as other FAANGs, so they want to make sure you're a star. That’s what the ‘Dream Team’ interview is about.”

One key thing you need to do before your Netflix behavioral interview is read their culture memo. Our interviewers tell us that if you don’t do this, you will fail the behavioral round.

#### Anecdote from a Netflix Engineer

“The culture illustrated in the [culture memo](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture) is sort of accurate to how the culture at Netflix actually is, but the actual culture is less intense. Team members tend to get along really well. You don’t compete with others in your performance review like it is at companies like Facebook. We’re not ranked against peers, so people are more willing to help each other out.”

Netflix will ask about impressive things you’ve done, as well as dig into your motivation (your “why”). This round will feel like you’re doing self-promotion. Typical questions will ask about your favorite project, latest project, and most significant project, as well as open-ended questions about what you’re looking for in your next role and why you’re interested in Netflix.

Promote yourself early and often in Netflix behavioral rounds. Promote yourself proactively. Metrics and impact statements are effective ways to promote yourself because they convey a sense of scale and complexity.

It can be nerve-wracking to talk to a director for 45-60 minutes. It’s more nerve-wracking when, out the gate, they ask you to describe the biggest thing you’ve ever worked on. When talking to a director, it’s more important to have metrics and impact statements.

How Netflix makes hiring decisions
----------------------------------

Netflix interviewers are untrained, their questions are unstandardized, their interviews are team-dependent, and their decision-making north star is “Why”. You can interview with multiple teams concurrently, effectively giving you multiple shots on goal.

There’s also no specific company-wide scale for performance at Netflix. This is different from, say, Google, where all candidates are graded on the same “Strong Hire, Hire, Neutral, No Hire, Strong No-Hire” scale. Different teams have different processes, but most decisions are made based on live post-onsite discussions.

“Netflix hiring decisions are black and white: pass or fail. And then you discuss if you'd be open to changing your mind. The only difference between Apple and Netflix was how they defined cultural fit. Besides that the hiring decisions were made in the same way: informal, mainly based on live discussions, binary decisions, and striving for consensus.”

Impression management is more powerful at companies that do live feedback discussions. To learn more about impression management, check out the resources to prepare for Netflix later in this section.

Other Netflix interview preparation resources
---------------------------------------------

The resources listed below are designed to help with various aspects of Netflix interview prep, from technical problem-solving to understanding the company’s core values.

Since Netflix has the most difficult system design screen (and their version of this round has a lot of overlap with other FAANGs), if you prep for Netflix, you’re also upskilling for system design rounds at all FAANGs. We recommend the following resources to all engineers interviewing at FAANG:

*   [A Senior Engineer's Guide to the System Design Interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)
*   Brush up on scaling, security, availability, microservices, and failure recovery/backups 
*   Research the hell out of the technology the team you’re interviewing with makes. Then practice taking a low-level system design question, coming to a quick solution, and then applying it to a piece of the real-world system this specific team works on. 
*   Practice low-level system design questions more than high-level ones.

These resources will help you “learn their language.” Then, when you communicate with Netflix, speak their language.

*   [Khan Academy’s intro to impression management](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/individuals-and-society/social-interactions/v/impression-management)

# [Grammarly’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/grammarly-interview-questions)

Published: January 15, 2024

## Grammarly's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Grammarly can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen (1 hour)
- Hiring Manager screen (1 hour)
- Onsite (5.5 hours)

![Grammarly’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Hiring Manager screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Grammarly_Interview_Process_4de1973fa7.png)

- Having a referral guarantees a call-back (not true at many other companies).
- Grinding on LeetCode will help because they primarily ask questions straight from LeetCode.
- They can be slow, so don’t be afraid to follow up a lot and keep reminding them you have other offer deadlines.
- Learn their [EAGER framework of values](https://www.grammarly.com/jobs). They will want you to know these and align with them during your interviews.
- It's a foreign-founded company, so you may encounter interviewers who aren’t native English speakers and have a different cultural style than you’re used to.

Grammarly has a hybrid process, which means that you will interview for a specific team and role but your interview panel will be a mix of engineers from the team and from elsewhere in the company. It will also include the hiring manager for the role you are interviewing for.

The entire process takes about 6 weeks, but our sources tell us it shouldn’t have to – by default, Grammarly is slow in moving things forward, but if you’re proactive, you can speed up the process.

Grammarly’s recruiter call lasts about 30 minutes, and it’s different from a lot of recruiter screens. Be prepared to get asked questions that require STAR-style responses. One of our sources was surprised by the style of question they got at this stage, so be prepared!

It’s also really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).

Grammarly’s technical phone screen lasts about an hour. It will be conducted in HackerRank, and you should expect medium-difficulty LeetCode-style questions.

This is a presentation and a deep dive into a complex project that you’ve worked on. For more senior roles, you’ll be asked to describe a project you led.

We’ve heard that you may not necessarily get clear instructions about this round, and you may not be told to prepare a presentation in advance, but we heartily recommend that you do! One of our sources did well in this round *because he already had a presentation prepared for another company and was able to seamlessly jump into it when he realized what the call was about*. Though it may not be critical to have a presentation fully prepared, doing so will give you an edge. Either way, come prepared to discuss the overall architecture (including diagrams as needed), what problem you were trying to solve, and your role in the successful completion of the project.

We’ve heard that Grammarly’s onsite is very long and can be split across multiple days.

- **Product intuition/domain expertise** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CodePair (HackerRank’s coding interview tool). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/grammarly-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **System design** (1 hour). This will likely be in Miro or HackerRank's whiteboarding tool. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/grammarly-interview-questions#question-design).
- **Coding / CS fundamentals** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CodePair. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/grammarly-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **Coffee chat (virtual)** (30 minutes). You meet with two people from your future team and get to ask them questions.
- **Values call 1** (1 hour) This interview will be with someone from Grammarly who isn’t from the org or team you are applying to. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Values section below](https://interviewing.io/grammarly-interview-questions#question-values) .
- **Values call 2** (1 hour) This interview will be conducted by a hiring manager. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Values section below](https://interviewing.io/grammarly-interview-questions#question-values) .

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Grammarly

From what we’ve heard, Grammarly doesn’t ask practical questions. They do have a standard bank of questions they regularly ask, and LeetCode-style questions are common.

### Product Intuition / Domain Expertise

This might be a two-part question and varies by role. In the first part, you could be shown an email with the Grammarly tool engaged and certain words or phrases highlighted. Your job will be to improve the product.

The second part will involve a standard LeetCode-style question.

Expect another two-part interview here with standard LeetCode-style questions in the first part.

The second part might be a lot more academic. One source told us:

> *"The second problem looked like it came straight out of an algorithms textbook.”*

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Grammarly interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Grammarly engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

This will likely be a two-part question where you’re asked to design something at a small scale in the first part and then asked to scale it up in the second. Time management is critical here because they will ask lots of questions during the first part. We’ve heard that this is a tough interview, but that you can do poorly, and potentially get a chance to redo it after the onsite.

Areas to focus on are:

- Client-server communication
- Separation of concerns
- Data structures and flows
- A system’s extensibility and scaling

You will have two calls that focus on Values, one with a hiring manager and the other with someone from a completely different part of the company. One of the people we interviewed for this guide was interviewed by someone from the Social Media team.

Both calls will ask questions about your past work experience. They will use your resume and frame their questions around your past companies. Be prepared to use their [EAGER framework](https://www.grammarly.com/about) of values, and show that you understand and embody the values they are looking for. EAGER stands for Ethical, Adaptable, Gritty, Empathetic, and Remarkable. Look for ways to show that you embody these values as you go through your interviews, even the technical ones.

Expect to go through each company you’ve worked from and answer questions like:

- What would your manager say your strengths were?
- What would your manager say your weaknesses were?
- What would you say your manager's strengths were?
- What would you say your manager's weaknesses were?

### How Grammarly Makes Hiring Decisions

The entire onsite panel submits written feedback after the interviews are completed and then meets to discuss. Most of the time, decisions are reached by consensus (everyone agrees to hire or no-hire), but in cases where consensus isn’t possible, the hiring manager has the final say.

# [HubSpot’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/hubspot-interview-questions)

Published: November 26, 2024

## HubSpot's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 2-4 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at HubSpot can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Asynchronous coding challenge (3 hour)
- Onsite (4 hours)

![HubSpot’s interview process: Recruiter call, Asynchronous coding challenge, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Hub_Spot_s_Interview_Process_c6178a59fd.png)

Hubspot’s hiring process is a hybrid. Although you apply for a specific team from the get-go, your interviews will likely not be with the people on your team – interviewers are randomly selected from a pool – except for the hiring manager interview.

Hubspot is one of the few companies that will actually give you some constructive post-interview feedback!

- LeetCode practice is helpful, as their coding questions are all in that style.
- During the coding rounds, it is important to find edge cases.
- You might read that they are very focused on the behavioral round and your ability to match up to their values, but in practice we’ve heard their behavioral round is pretty standard. That said, the interviewers will talk about the culture so it’s best to come prepared with questions about their values.
- They use Java, but the interview process is language-agnostic.
- You must convince the interviewer you are familiar with the technologies you mention in a system design interview. You need to know more than buzzwords.
- They know that most of their questions are found online, so they look for you to go deeper.
- You’ll get detailed feedback from the recruiter after the technical onsite rounds. This can be given verbally or via email and will happen before the behavioral round.

The hiring process takes about 2-4 weeks, and we’ve heard that their interviewers are pretty friendly and collaborative compared to FAANG companies. They are also competitive with FAANG salaries.

HubSpot’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in HubSpot, and what you’re looking for moving forward. They will discuss salary ranges, and we’ve heard they are competitive with Meta and Google.

### Step 2: Asynchronous Coding Challenge

In this challenge, you’ll get API access. You’ll need to make a call to the API, process data, and POST back a response/solution. If the solution is correct, you’ll get a 200 status code, which means you’ve completed the exercise.

You can use any language for this assignment, and it starts as soon as you click the link in the email they will send you. You have three hours to complete the assignment, i.e., make the request to the API. After that, you’ll need to submit the code in a zip file, but that doesn’t need to happen within the three hour window, so you’ll have time to clean up your code afterward.

One engineer we spoke to said:

> *I don’t think they even review the code, you just need to get 200, and that’s good enough to pass.*

Another engineer we spoke to described the problem as follows:

> *Overall, the pattern is going to be a sorting/aggregating approach to a JSON array, where you have some field like “timestamp”, and some other field that might be an enum, and you will be posting it back to the API provided*

This will vary slightly between Senior SWE 1 and Senior SWE 2 but only during the second system design round. **You have to pass each round before moving on to the next.**

- **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad, but we have heard you can use your own IDE too. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/hubspot-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in the drawing tool of your choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/hubspot-interview-questions#question-design).
- **System design 2 (depending on your level, details are different)** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/hubspot-interview-questions#question-design).
- **Behavioral** (1 hour). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/hubspot-interview-questions#question-behavioral).

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at HubSpot

This will be algorithms and data structures-focused, with LeetCode-style questions. We’ve heard they usually ask LeetCode easy to mediums. While the challenge might seem easy, HubSpot wants you to catch all the edge cases and run tests.

Communication and clarifying questions are things they are looking for. They know their questions can be found online. They expect you have already seen and solved them.

Some examples of the question types they ask are:

- Most repeated substring of size k
- Find the matching string pattern in a given string.
- Find all commonly repeated strings in the 'engineering' string one. How to create an add comma function in js and add it to the global
- Merge two sorted lists up to size k

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in HubSpot interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former HubSpot engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

Your first system design round will be very standard. You’ll be asked to design something like Netflix. The main difference between HubSpot and other companies is that they aren’t as obsessed with you mapping out the most optimized solution. It’s more about capturing a broad answer than going deep into one solution.

Your second system design will depend on which role you are interviewing for.

#### Senior SWE 1 (Equivalent to L4 at other companies)

You will usually be asked to design something like a weather service. One engineer we spoke to described it as being more like application design. The areas you need to consider are:

- Data storage
- Reliability
- Performance
- Horizontal scaling
- Trade-offs

Make sure to ask clarifying questions before you do anything. Their interviewers are collaborative. If you bring up any technologies, you need to know them well as they will drill into them.

#### Senior SWE 2 (Equivalent to L5 at other companies)

This system design round is split into two parts. First, you will be asked to write a document covering a past, technically challenging project and submit it for review They want you to list everything involved from start to finish, including:

- An overview of business problem
- The challenges faced
- The technical implementation
- Any design tradeoffs
- The rollout plan
- The chosen success metrics
- Any lessons learned

They will review your write-up, and, if they like it, you will be invited to another live interview where they will ask you questions about the project.

This interview will be conducted by the hiring manager of the team you are interviewing for. It’s going to be pretty standard, with situational questions. As above, they may talk about the culture at HubSpot so it’s a good idea to come prepared with questions that delve into their values.

Decisions are reached based on your performance in each round. You can still get an offer with one “no-hire”, but your other rounds need to be very strong for this to happen. Hiring managers may still reject candidates in the team matching phase if they see one “no-hire”.

# [Instacart’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/instacart-interview-questions)

Published: October 22, 2023

## Instacart's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Instacart can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen (45 mins)
- Onsite (3-4 hours)

![Instacart’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Instacart_s_Company_Process_7854cd3a14.png)

Instacart has a hybrid hiring process: it’s not fully decentralized or centralized. You usually apply or get brought in for a generic job listing, and then they will determine which team you interview for. Your interviewers will come from all across the org, but the hiring manager for the role you are interviewing for will usually be involved from the start. You can only interview once, but if you don’t get an offer from the team you interviewed with, you may still have a chance with another team.

The entire process takes about 2-4 weeks.

- Instacart doesn’t ask questions that require knowledge of academic or obscure data structures and algorithms. Although questions can still skew LeetCode-y, they won’t be questions that require knowledge of niche trees, dynamic programming, etc. Brush up on the basics, and you should be fine.
- Make sure you practice system design, as that interview is often make or break and is definitely used for leveling

Instacart’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, and why you’re interested in Instacart. They’ll also talk about the specific role and team you’ve been matched with.

Instacart’s technical phone screen lasts about an hour. They use CodeSignal.

- **Coding** (45 mins). Like the technical phone screen, this round will be conducted in CodeSignal, and you can use any language that CodeSignal supports. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/instacart-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **Second coding**. As above.
- **System design** (45 mins). This section is really important and usually where people fail. You can use any tooling you’d like, e.g., Google Draw or Excalidraw. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/instacart-interview-questions#question-design).
- **Behavioral** (45 mins). This interview will be conducted by a hiring manager. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/instacart-interview-questions#question-behavioral).

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Instacart

A lot of Instacart’s questions are created in-house, but you may run into LeetCode-style questions as well.

You’ll be tested for pragmatic coding skills here. You might be asked to write a script to convert dollars to euros, get a question about API optimization, be asked about designing key-value stories, edit distance, expression evaluation, combinatorics, file I/O, or any number of other fairly practical questions.

In recent years, as Instacart has hired more FAANG alums, the question composition has shifted a bit to include more LeetCode-style questions. That said, even if you do get a LeetCode question, it will likely NOT touch on obscure algorithms or data structures.

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Instacart interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Instacart engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

System design interviews at Instacart matter a lot for leveling. The most common failure mode we heard about was passing the coding portion and then failing on architecture.

Specifically, if you want to hit at least L6, you NEED to do well in this interview.

The engineers we spoke to said that in the system design portion, it’s really important to manage your time because there’s typically a lot you can cover with your answer, but they are looking for you to be concise. Also be prepared to justify your design decisions.

You might be asked to:

- Design a database model for an Instacart-like system
- Design a system for tracking shipments
- Design a system for communicating with a payment processor

Instacart’s behavioral interviews are pretty standard fare. You’ll be asked about past projects and your impact in previous roles. This interview is primarily used for leveling.

### How Instacart Makes Hiring Decisions

Hiring decisions are made by rough consensus. There’s a debrief the same day or the day after your interview loop. People vote, but ultimately the decision rests with the hiring manager. From one of the engineers we spoke to:

“*If there’s one strong no, that’s usually the end of it, and a strong yes from someone else probably wouldn’t countermand that.*”

Published: May 8, 2024

## Jane Street's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Jane Street can expect the following hiring process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen (1 hour)
- Onsite (5 hours)

![Jane Street’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Jane_Street_s_Interview_Process_a3566cc29a.png)

At Jane Street, the process is centralized, i.e., you interview with a central team and then get matched to a specific team after you pass the onsite loop.

- Work on your coding stamina - the onsite is pretty intense.
- Practice coding something up from scratch – during the onsite, they’ll ask you to build something from nothing, e.g., a Tetris game
- Their interviewers want you to be collaborative, so ask lots of questions and communicate well throughout the process. They value collaboration as much as they do good code.
- Read Jane Street’s [blog post about their interview process](https://blog.janestreet.com/applying-to-jane-street/). Unlike most company pages, it’s detailed, useful, and good, and talks a lot about engineering interviews, specifically.
- Don’t try to impress them by coding in OCaml (their internal functional language of choice). Use the language you’re most comfortable in.

The entire process takes about 4 weeks.

Jane Street’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Jane Street, your understanding of Jane Street’s value proposition, and what you’re looking for moving forward.

This is a pretty standard technical round, with one LeetCode medium-style question that will have two parts. Your interviewer will be more interested in how you think and how you arrive at the solution than an optimal solution. Communicate your assumptions and discuss alternate approaches as you work your way through the problem.

- **3 coding / system design hybrid rounds** (75 mins each). These interviews will be conducted in CoderPad. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding / System Design section](https://interviewing.io/jane-street-interview-questions#question-coding) below.
- **Technical project deep dive** (75 mins). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Technical project deep dive section](https://interviewing.io/jane-street-interview-questions#question-project) below.

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Jane Street

### Coding / System Design

Whereas the technical screen before the onsite is LeetCode-style and more academic, the coding rounds during the onsite are a little bit more practical. They also blend coding and system design so you might have to whiteboard out some pieces initially before jumping into code.

You will get a problem statement that is underspecified. Your job is to ask the right questions before you dive in and while you are working. Get comfortable building things from scratch. You might be asked to:

- Design Tetris
- Design a video player API

You’ll have to design it, code it out, and go deep into the logic.

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Jane Street interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Jane Street engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

### Technical Project Deep Dive

You will be asked to present an interesting, technically complex project that you’ve worked on, ideally something that you can talk about for an hour. They tell you not to over-prepare for this one, so you don’t necessarily need a robust presentation, but do prepare to answer a lot of questions about the project you’re presenting, the reasoning and logic behind it, and its impact.

# [LinkedIn’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/linkedin-interview-questions)

## LinkedIn's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 5 Steps

For a mid to senior-level software engineer, LinkedIn’s process (usually) looks like this:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen (1 hour)
- Second recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Onsite (5-6 hours)
- Team matching

![LinkedIn’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Recruiter call, Onsite, Team matching ](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Linked_In_Company_Process_7af8ecb3ab.png)

LinkedIn’s interview process is centralized, which means that you don’t interview with specific teams and do team matching after the fact.

The first recruiter call lasts 30 minutes. Its purpose is to check qualifications, hear about past projects, and find out what you’re looking for from LinkedIn and in general. It also acts as a culture fit check, so they’ll want to see how your communication and personality align with their values. Make sure you’re up to date on LinkedIn features, blog posts and news. Finally, your recruiter will make sure you understand the role you’re applying for and clarify next steps in the process.

The technical phone screen lasts an hour, and interviews at this stage (and beyond) will usually have two interviewers, the primary interviewer and a trainee interviewer who’s shadowing.

You’ll be given 2-3 algorithms and data structures questions, structured as follows:

- If you’re applying for a niche role (e.g., mobile), you’ll get a 10-minute domain-specific question. This question is meant to quickly  gauge your expertise on your niche subject and screen out generalists.
- 15-minute small problem
- 30-minute medium problem

If you pass the technical phone screen, a recruiter will reach out again for a 30 minute call. Having a second recruiter call in the middle of the process is unusual, but LinkedIn does it for a good reason: they have historically lost a lot of good candidates to FAANG, and so this call is their way of playing defense to get ahead of attrition. In this call, they’ll re-ask about whom you’re in process with and will try to make sure that they don’t lose you by moving too slowly.

Though our advice about not revealing your hand stands, in this call, if you do have any tight timelines from other companies, it’s good to let them know because, according to our sources, they are indeed able to speed things up and move quickly.

LinkedIn’s onsite usually lasts 5-6 hours and includes the following steps:

The order of these rounds can vary, as well as the number of coding interviews required. Depending on your score for various portions of the onsite, you may be required to complete an extra system design, object oriented design, or algorithms interview. There may be extra rounds for certain teams and roles as well. Given that LinkedIn’s interview process is centralized, you generally won’t be interviewing with engineers or managers from the team you’ll end up on.

This interview will generally be one question or sometimes two, depending on how quickly you work through the first one.

#### (For Niche Roles) Domain-Specific Coding

If you’re applying for a niche role (e.g., mobile), in addition to a general coding interview, you’ll have to do a domain-specific interview as well.

The [system design interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) will cover general system design knowledge and will focus on building large-scale systems. Make sure to communicate clearly and often during this interview and substantiate your design choices as well as your choices of specific technologies.

#### Technical Communication

This interview will evaluate your ability to communicate and collaborate. You’ll be asked about one of your past projects and then walk your interviewer through it, with an emphasis on the technical aspects of your projects. Make sure you explain what the project was, why it mattered to the business, and what you did specifically. They’re expecting you to be able to dive really deep into the project you choose, so be ready to answer anything and everything about it.

The behavioral interview at LinkedIn is very conversational. They’re looking to assess your culture fit and will ask you ad-hoc questions rather than preset or typical behavioral interview questions. Despite it being conversational in nature, it’s important to find ways to tie your answers to LinkedIn’s values:

- We put members first
- We trust and care about each other
- We are open, honest and constructive
- We act as One LinkedIn
- We embody diversity, inclusion and belonging
- We dream big, get things done and know how to have fun

### Step 5: Team matching

Assuming all has gone well to this point, you’ll be contacted by hiring managers for a team matching call. These calls are for the hiring managers to sell you on joining LinkedIn, and to create excitement about their specific orgs. It’s important to use this time to ask any questions you have about LinkedIn, the role or the process so far, and find out as much as possible about your team options.

Once you’re matched with a team they will extend you an offer. If you are far along in the process with other companies, make sure that you let them know that they should move quickly. This is another stage where LinkedIn loses a lot of candidates to FAANG, so they’re ready and able to speed things up.

In the event you’re unable to be matched with a team, your onsite results are valid with LinkedIn for 1 year, so they will continue trying to find a team for you.

LinkedIn has a company-wide question bank, though interviewers have a bit of wiggle room to change them up. We’ve heard from several sources that the question bank is fairly small (compared to other companies), and that the questions haven’t changed much over the past 7 years or more.

To figure out what specific types of questions to expect in your LinkedIn interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former LinkedIn interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you’re likely to encounter:

Typical [system design](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) questions include:

- Design a system that will determine trending posts
- Design a system that will log requests
- Design a system that will show client feeds
- Design an API for some specific use case

## Common LinkedIn Interview Questions

Below are common questions that interviewers from LinkedIn ask on our platform. Since our data comes from mock interviews, questions may not be exactly the same as what you'd see in real interviews.

### [Find Leaves of a Binary Tree](https://interviewing.io/questions/find-leaves-of-binary-tree)

[Given a binary tree, extract all the leaves in repeated succession into a list of lists by starting at the bottom and working your way upwards.](https://interviewing.io/questions/find-leaves-of-binary-tree)

## How LinkedIn Makes Hiring Decisions

LinkedIn grades each onsite round on a 4-point scale, where 3 is passing. If your aggregate score after the onsite is borderline, you may get asked to do another interview.

Candidates who end up over the line get passed to the hiring committee, who make the final decision about both hiring and leveling.

# [Morgan Stanley’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/morgan-stanley-interview-questions)

Published: October 30, 2023

## Morgan Stanley's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Morgan Stanley can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Online assessment (only for some teams) (45 mins)
- Onsite (3-4 hours)

![Morgan Stanley’s interview process: Recruiter call, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Morgan_Stanley_s_Company_Process_e08eede811.png)

Morgan Stanley has a decentralized hiring process. Each team interviews in its own style, and there are variations in the numbers and types of interviews you might encounter. A lot of it depends on the region you are interviewing in. You can apply to and interview for multiple roles simultaneously.

Your interviewers will be selected from the team you are interviewing for by the hiring manager, based on their ability to assess you for specific skills, e.g., if the role requires you to be a Python expert, they will use another Python expert to interview you. The order of your interviews for the onsite portion is not predetermined, and the hiring manager will decide the schedule based on the availability of the interviewers deemed necessary.

The process can be quite slow, and they will not expedite things unless they feel like you are a perfect fit. Expect the process to last more than 6 weeks in most cases.

- There is a big focus on collaboration, so don’t be combative in interviews.
- Communication is important for leveling. They want to know if you can communicate cross-functionally or potentially manage a team in the future.
- Practice the STAR method of answering behavioral interview questions.
- Just because you don’t get a job with one team doesn’t mean you’ve failed with Morgan Stanley as a whole. You don’t need to wait a year to apply to other teams, and you might find a more suitable role in the course of that same job search.

Morgan Stanley’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, and why you’re interested in Morgan Stanley. They’ll look for basic skill set alignment. They’ll also talk about the specific role and team you’ve been matched with.

### Step 2: Onsite

Again, this will vary in terms of interview types and order depending on the team you are interviewing with, but here is a sample schedule:

- **Asynchronous coding challenge** (45 mins). This challenge will be conducted in HackerRank. For some teams, this may happen before the onsite rather than as part of it. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/morgan-stanley-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **Language-specific coding** (45 mins). Morgan Stanley is one of the few companies we’ve written about whose process isn’t always language agnostic. For some roles and teams, they may need you to know a specific language, and if that’s the case, they will do one round in that language where they’re specifically vetting you for familiarity with that language and its idiosyncrasies. This round is usually conducted in HackerRank. .
- **Data structures and algorithms** (45 mins). This round is usually conducted in HackerRank. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/morgan-stanley-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **Object-oriented programming** (45 mins). This will not be a coding interview. You’ll be asked a series of questions on the topic of object-oriented programming. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Object-Oriented Programming section below](https://interviewing.io/morgan-stanley-interview-questions#question-object-programming).
- **Behavioral** (45 mins) This is a team fit call with the hiring manager. Morgan Stanley’s behavioral interviews are pretty standard fare. You’ll be asked about past projects and your impact in previous roles.

You might notice the lack of a system design interview in the schedule above. This is typical for a lot of teams although you might interview for a team that includes one. If you do get a system design interview you might be asked product-focused system design questions.

Be prepared for some repetition here. You should be ready to drive into your own product designs.

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Morgan Stanley

Managers tend to come up with their own questions, but for core coding interviews, prepping on LeetCode will be very helpful. A lot of the teams will pull questions from there.

As above, you’ll run into a lot of LeetCode-style questions here. Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Morgan Stanley interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Morgan Stanley engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

### Object-Oriented Programming

Below are the types of questions you’ll likely be asked during this interview:

- Explain object-oriented programming. What is inheritance? What are the different types of inheritance?
- What is polymorphism?
- Give an example of operator overloading
- What is the difference between a struct and a class?
- What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
- What is the difference between object-oriented programming and procedural programming?

### How Morgan Stanley Makes Hiring Decisions

Decisions are at the hiring manager's discretion. Some managers will make the decision themselves, and most will take feedback, but they do overrule negative feedback at times.

# [Nvidia’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/nvidia-interview-questions)

Published: September 8, 2024

## Nvidia's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 2-4 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Nvidia can expect the following process:

- [Can skip if referred in] Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen (1 hour)
- [Not always] Hiring Manager call (30 minutes)
- Onsite (5 hours)

![Nvidia’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Hiring manager call, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nvidia_company_process_a84381e04f.png)

Nvidia has a decentralized process that varies based on the hiring manager's preference, e.g., some people we spoke with had no recruiter screen and some had no hiring manager call before the onsite. One candidate even had their hiring manager call first, before anything else happened! The onsite rounds can also change a lot. We will do our best to sketch out the process, but yours may differ depending on the role you are interviewing for. While there is some flexibility regarding what role you end up interviewing for, you don’t seem to be able to interview for multiple teams. All of your interviewers will be from the team you are interviewing for.

One engineer we spoke to, who interviewed with Nvidia for two separate teams told us:

> *If you get an early hiring manager call, you can ask them exactly what to expect in the rest of the rounds. If they say the language is the priority, brush up on those skills, if they say it will be more general, then focus on general coding.*

- LeetCode practice will help, but they will throw in more practical questions too.
- They don’t have an internal question bank, so the interview questions are up to the individual interviewer.
- Nvidia puts a premium on experience and advanced academic degrees.
- A good (senior) referral can help you skip the recruiter call.
- Most roles they hire for are software-orientedsoftware oriented, not hardware as you might expect
- If you fail with one team, you can immediately interview with another one, but you will have to go through the whole process again, though it’s possible you’ll be able to skip the technical phone screen.
- They will always have at least one interview that is focused on the language you will need for whatever team you are joining.

The entire process takes about 6-8 weeks.

Nvidia’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, and why you’re interested in Nvidia and do some basic skills assessment.

You might start with 15 minutes of general chat in this round but, the guts of the interview will be technical. In the general chat, you might be asked about your background and why you’re interested in Nvidia. The technical portion will be 45 minutes long. One engineer we spoke to was asked only LLM questions here and everything was done in PyTorch, but this is largely dependent on the role you are interviewing for. Nvidia is very focused on hiring engineers with LLM experience right now so, if that’s what you applied to, expect LLM questions rather than general CS skill questions. If not, expect a LeetCode medium-style question, but remember, they don’t have an internal bank from what we’ve heard, so you might get something more practical too.

If you are asked LLM questions, expect them to focus on concepts such as:

- Mixture-of-experts model
- Beam search
- Autoregressive decoding with KV-cache
- Low-rank adaptation (LoRA)
- High-level distributed computing

For example, you might be asked to implement beam search for LLM inference and evaluate the time complexity of each operation.

This is usually split into two parts. You will be asked about your background and experience in the first part. The hiring manager will be testing for culture fit. In the second part, they will be selling you on the role and team.

This will vary by role but here’s what you can expect.

- **Coding x 2** (1 hour each). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/nvidia-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **System design** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/nvidia-interview-questions#question-design).
- **Second Coding** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding (domain-specific) section below](https://interviewing.io/nvidia-interview-questions#question-domain).
- **Hiring Manager** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Hiring Manager interview section below](https://interviewing.io/nvidia-interview-questions#question-manager).

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Nvidia

Ok, things can vary quite a bit here, as with everything in the Nvidia hiring process! One engineer we spoke to had 2 low-level coding rounds that were very practical and domain-aligned for the team he interviewed with. Others got more standard LeetCode-style questions during these two rounds.

We also heard that there are different formats for the coding rounds for certain teams. You might get a problem to solve in some and have to review existing code in others, similar to a debugging round.

If the role you have applied to will rely heavily on Cuda, expect to be interviewed in C++. Every role at Nvidia is a bit different though so lot’s of languages are used. It should be clear from the job description if there is a specific language required. If not, ask the hiring manager in advance so you are prepared!

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Nvidia interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Nvidia engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews.

First, here’s a list of more niche technical topics that are, in our experience, specific to Nvidia:

- C++ Fundamentals
- LLMs
  - See the [technical phone screen section above](https://interviewing.io/nvidia-interview-questions#step-2) for examples of LLM sub-topics

### Coding (Domain-Specific)

This will be a more practical round. You might be asked to reimplement an algorithm from first principles. You might get a mix of technical questions and actual coding to do. Whatever you get will be specific to the role you are interviewing for.

This will more than likely be a pretty standard system design round but, again, things vary from team to team. Brush up on the usual questions like “How would you design Twitter / Uber / a chatbot for a website,” BUT they may ask you something more practical for the role. Learn about CPU/GPU architecture and anything else relevant to the team you are interviewing for!

This will be more conversational than the other rounds but could have behavioral/experience-based questions, as well as technical questions depending on the hiring manager.

### How Nvidia Makes Hiring Decisions

After the onsite, the panel all submit a scorecard. You don’t need to score perfectly (it’s from 1-5) on each scorecard, but it’s unlikely to be hired if you’ve scored poorly on even one round.

# [OpenAI’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/openai-interview-questions)

Published: March 24, 2024

## OpenAI's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3-4 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at OpenAI can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen (1 hour)
- Possible 2nd technical screen or assessment, where the format depends on the role (1 hour)
- Onsite (4-6 hours)

- Your recruiter will give you detailed tips on what to prepare for before some interviews. Take the tips seriously!
- The coding questions you’ll get are more practical than LeetCode. They are algorithms and data structures questions, but they are actual things that you might do at work.
- Prepare slides for the presentation part of the onsite (even though it’s not required).
- Be prepared to discuss ethics and safety in AI. Read their blog!

The hiring process at OpenAI is decentralized, with a lot of variation in interview steps and styles depending on the role and team you are interviewing for. You will get some sort of technical assessment before the onsite, and it can be anything from a technical phone screen, an asynchronous assessment, or a take-home project. It may even be two separate steps. We’ve heard they use HackerRank for asynchronous coding tests but CoderPad for live interviews. This guide will assume that there will be two live technical phone screens, but your mileage may vary depending on team and role – check out [OpenAI’s own interview guide](https://openai.com/interview-guide) for more info.

![OpenAI’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, 2nd Technical Screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Open_AI_interview_process_cd24f67a14.png)

At OpenAI, there is some flexibility in terms of which role and team you might end up on – you might apply to one role but have them suggest others as you move through the process. Your interviewers will probably come from multiple different teams. Prepare for it to feel chaotic.

From one of our users who recently interviewed with Open AI:

> *“Everything they did made them seem wildly disorganized. They didn’t stay in touch through the process. A lot of radio silence."*

The entire process can take 6-8 weeks, but if you put pressure on them throughout you can speed things up, especially if you mention that you have other offers.

OpenAI’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in OpenAI, your understanding of OpenAI’s value proposition, and what you’re looking for moving forward.

In this round, your recruiter will also tell you what to expect in the next round, given how much variability there is in the interview process for different roles and teams. Your recruiter will also be in touch throughout the interview process to prep you for what’s coming up next.

OpenAI’s first technical phone screen lasts about an hour and is conducted in CoderPad. This is an algorithms and data structures style interview, but the questions are more practical than questions you’d find on LeetCode. We will cover what we know of their question style in the section called [“Types of Interview Questions to Expect at OpenAI”](https://interviewing.io/openai-interview-questions#question-types) below.

### Step 3: Second Technical Phone Screen or Assessment

The format of this round varies by role and will be more domain-specific than the previous round. For instance, you may get an asynchronous exercise or a take-home assignment. Or you may have to do another technical phone screen.

We expect that for many of our readers, who tend to be senior, back-end focused engineers, this round will be an architecture interview. See the [System Design section](https://interviewing.io/openai-interview-questions#question-design) below for more details on question types.

*If you have more information about this part of the process or see anything that’s incorrect, please fill in [our form](https://iiosurveys.typeform.com/to/LXqccdMk)*

Onsite interview loops also vary slightly depending on the role and seniority, but the below is generally what you’ll get:

- **Behavioral interview with a senior manager** (45 mins) This is a phone call with a hiring manager, typically someone quite senior at the company. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section](https://interviewing.io/openai-interview-questions#question-behavioral) below.
- **Presentation** (45 mins) You’ll be asked to prepare this in advance. For more detail, see the [Presentation section](https://interviewing.io/openai-interview-questions#question-presentation) below.
- **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in your own IDE with screen-share or in CoderPad. Your choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section](https://interviewing.io/openai-interview-questions#question-coding) below.
- **System design** (1 hour). You'll use Excalidraw for this round. For more detail about what kind of questions to expect, see the [System Design section](https://interviewing.io/openai-interview-questions#question-design) below.
- **Behavioral interview focused on working with teams** (30 mins). This and the hiring manager screen above are both behavioral. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section](https://interviewing.io/openai-interview-questions#question-behavioral) below.

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at OpenAI

All of OpenAI’s interview questions have a degree of practicality and are usually language agnostic.

OpenAI’s onsite coding interviews will be more practical than many companies’. Although you will still get algorithmic questions, they are going to be about stuff you might actually do at work.

> *“You’re not going to get questions on string manipulation.”*

In these interviews, they are looking for your ability to write code that is going to be fast enough now but flexible enough to scale and adapt in the future.

You can choose the language for the coding rounds, and the questions are picked based on whichever language you choose.

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in OpenAI interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former OpenAI engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

First, here’s a list of more niche technical topics that are, in our experience, specific to OpenAI:

- Time-based data structures
- Versioned data stores
- Coroutines in your chosen language (multithreading, concurrency, etc.)
- object-oriented programming concepts (abstract classes, iterator classes, inheritance, etc.)

You may get two system design rounds during the interview loop, one before the onsite and one during.

If you get one before the onsite, expect something practical – you might be asked to design Yelp, Foursquare, Twitter, or a notifications system.

In this round, they probe for depth of knowledge and will ask a bunch of follow-up questions. It’s also best not to name-drop names of tools:

> *“If you call out any specific technologies during this round, be prepared to go into detail about them! It may be best not to bring up specific examples as they seem to like drilling into the pros and cons of your choice.”*

Although a more domain-specific interview may pop up for some roles, most engineers will get another system design round during the onsite. You will likely be prepped well for the topic of this interview, so pay attention to any tips they give you beforehand. If you got a system design round before the onsite, the style of question that you get in the onsite round will be very similar, though they may ask you to get into more detail.

We have heard that OpenAI might ask you to code in this interview. One user told us that they designed a solution to the problem that was posed to them but were then asked to code up a new solution using a different method.

### Presentation

You’ll be asked to present a project you worked on to a senior manager. You won’t specifically be asked to prepare slides, but it’s a very good idea to do so. Be prepared to discuss the technical and business aspects and impact of the project, as well as your level of contribution, what tradeoffs were made, what other team members were involved, and what everyone’s responsibilities were. You may get some behavioral questions about how you worked with the team.

#### Senior Manager Call

This is often with someone pretty high up at OpenAI. Our sources tell us it can be an interesting call. Although a lot of the questions will be standard, you may also be asked to delve deeper into something on your resume that catches the eye.

From one source who interviewed with OpenAI recently:

> *"This interview was with John Rizzo, who is a well-known employee at OpenAI. It wasn’t an intense call, and John asked me some great questions about my background. It felt like he might have had veto power, but I enjoyed the call."*

It’s also a good idea to read OpenAI’s blog, particularly any articles that discuss ethics and safety in AI. They want to know that you’ve thought about the topic, so prepare yourself!

#### Working with Teams

This is another type of behavioral interview you might encounter. Expect questions about times:

- You had to work cross-functionally across teams
- You’ve experienced conflict between teams or roles
- You’ve had competing ideas to move a project forward within your own team.

All of these questions are meant to get at your ability to work collaboratively.

# [Palantir’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions)

Published: March 10, 2024

## Palantir's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Palantir can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen (1 hour)
- Onsite (3 hour)
- Hiring manager screen (1 hour)

- They put a huge emphasis on cultural fit. Behavioral questions will be asked in every interview. Come prepared!
- Palantir believes in protecting civil liberties and rights. They look for people who are comfortable discussing these topics.
- It’s a mix of standard LeetCode-style questions and very non-standard questions. LeetCode prep isn’t going to be enough here.

![Palantir’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite, Hiring manager interview](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Palantir_interview_process_af7ed42bbf.png)

At Palantir, you apply for a catch-all backend or full stack role and team matching will happen later in the process. The process doesn’t vary much between roles although there are some variations for different levels of seniority. The recruiter might adjust the track you are on very slightly through the process but you’re more likely to do team matching after the onsite.

The entire process takes and 3-4 weeks but it’s possible to expedite things, especially with other offers in hand.

Palantir’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s an important step. They filter out more candidates than most companies do at this stage from what we hear. They are looking for your motivations to join the company, so come to this call prepared to discuss why you want to be there in detail. It helps to have a compelling story as to what drew you to Palantir. You might get asked about your favorite, and least favorite past projects, as well as what you want to work on moving forward. They look for any red flags indicating you won’t be there long-term. An engineer who knows their process very well says:

> *“Surface-level motivations to join the company won’t get you far and they will reject strong technical candidates if they don’t seem like a good cultural fit!”*

Palantir’s technical phone screen lasts about an hour and happens in CodePair. This interview will feature algorithms and data structures but, the difference is that it won’t be purely technical and the algorithm you are solving will be put in the context of something you are building for an end-user. You’ll get asked to solve a problem in one half of the interview and behavioral questions in the other half. We will cover what we know of their question style in the section called [“Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Palantir” below](https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions#question-types).

Palantir has 4 types of interviews they give most engineers during the onsite loop. **You will only get 3 of the 4, but we will describe each here.**

Every onsite interview will have 20 minutes of behavioral questions!

- **Problem decomposition** (1 hour). This is one of the options that you will almost definitely get. It’s really important and non-standard. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Problem decomposition section below](https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions#question-problem-decomposition).
- **System design** (1 hour). This will be conducted in CodePair using the whiteboard functionality. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions#question-design).
- **Re-engineering** (1 hour). You’ll be given a piece of code in CodePair and asked to review it for bugs. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Re-engineering section below](https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions#question-reengineering).
- **Coding** (1 hour). This will be similar to the technical screen before the onsite, and is conducted in CodePair. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions#question-coding).

### Step 4: Hiring Manager Interview

This interview will be a repeat of one of the onsite interviews. They look for red flags during the onsite and like to revisit any area they felt wasn’t up to scratch. It might not even be the technical piece they want to review! Again, the behavioral questions are very important.

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Palantir

We can’t stress enough how embedded behavioral questions are at Palantir. As there is no behavioral interview during the onsite, they like to assess your motivations, cultural fit, and ability to work collaboratively all through the process. Come prepared with STAR-style answers, stories about why you want to work for Palantir, and ways you’ve thought about the end-user experience in other roles. If you propose a solution, talk about how it could be improved or modified for the users' benefit. You will also be asked about what projects you’ve enjoyed and not enjoyed. They want to know you’re OK working on all sorts of projects, not just glamorous ones.

The coding problems posed before are during the onsite will reflect the type of work you will be doing at Palantir, i.e., building products for end-users. So, while the core technical question might look like a standard LeetCode-style problem, it will be put in the context of a larger solution for an end-user. You’ll have to solve the problem but also consider and discuss its impact on the whole system, and how it will be used by the user. You’ll need to ask a lot of clarifying questions as it will be under-defined at first. Just keep thinking about the end-user and what trade-offs you will have to make in order to make the user experience positive. Maybe your solution is memory intensive, or maybe it's more runtime complexity intensive - think about and discuss improvements you could make to help the user in future iterations. They value user-centric thinking and empathy in finding solutions over algorithmic complexity. Think about how the user will use the code and how it could be improved, e.g., maybe you could implement caching so the user has a better experience each time they use the solution.

A user who is very familiar with the Palantir interview process had this to say:

> *“What strategies do you consider for enhancing performance beyond just the code you’re currently working on? Consider aspects such as caching and pre-computation to improve efficiency. Initially, your solution may not be the fastest, but implementing these strategies could significantly speed up subsequent operations.*
>
> *"Expect the problem to be intentionally vague. It’s important to anticipate and address any ambiguous scenarios, demonstrate caution regarding potential issues, and safeguard the system from malicious users.”*

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Palantir interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Palantir engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

Again, this will be an industry standard round bar the added behavioral aspects. Our [system design guide](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) has been called “excellent preparation” by someone very familiar with Palantir’s interview.

### Re-engineering

In this interview, you will be given a bunch of code in CodePair and asked to review it for bugs. You’ll be told how the system is supposed to work and that the output is wrong when you run the code. It will be about 500-100 lines of code, and it’s really important not to get lost in the first issue you see. Review everything from top to bottom as they will probably put in red herrings to distract you!

### Problem Decomposition

This is probably the most important technical round you will face. It’s a non-standard interview where you will be asked to solve a high-level, real-world technical problem, with a real focus on thinking about the end-user. You won’t have to write code outside of maybe some pseudocode.

The problem might be something like:

*"How would you design a technology to help elderly people with poor vision who want to cook for themselves?"*

It will be focused on an individual or an organization. Your goal is to come up with how to use technology to solve this problem. A lot of the focus here is on breaking the problem down into its component parts so you can tackle it. You’ll need to think about the time your solution will take, as well as how the respective parts of the solution might be built by different teams.

There will be two parts:

- Ideation: Break the problem down into its respective pieces and propose a solution to each. Agree on the solution with your interviewer.
- Execution: How you would design the solution at a high-level. This is more like system design. You won’t need to go too deep technically, e.g., you won’t need to provide detail on the type of database you would use, but you might discuss the type of data / schema you’d need to solve the problem.

The important thing here is, as with other rounds, to focus on the end-user. Think about how your solution would be used. Discuss ways to make it better. You’re being asked to display both your ability to problem-solve and your ability to empathize with users/clients.

After the onsite, the interview panel meets with a hiring manager to discuss your performance. If you pass, they’ll match you with a team that needs your skillset. From there, you’ll interview again with the hiring manager for that team. This will be your final round and it will repeat one of the above rounds. If they see a red flag around motivation or culture fit, they’ll be looking to test you on it again.

### How Palantir Makes Hiring Decisions

The final decision rests with the hiring manager you interview with last from what we can tell.

# [Rippling’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/rippling-interview-questions)

Published: February 8, 2024

## Rippling's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Rippling can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (15-30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen (1 hour)
- Hiring manager screen (1 hour)
- Onsite (3-4 hours)

General Tips:

- Rippling places a big emphasis on testing and running code during interviews
- Grinding on LeetCode medium and hard questions will help - you will need to move fast!
- System design round is used for leveling

![Rippling’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Hiring manager screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Rippling_Company_Process_78740d50a1.png)

Rippling has a decentralized hiring process, which means that you interview for a specific role and will most likely be interviewed by people from that team, including a hiring manager. They seem to have recently moved to a decentralized process from a centralized one.

The entire process takes about 4-6 weeks but can be completed in as little as two weeks. Getting a referral might help you skip certain steps like online assessments and initial recruiter screens, but this seems to vary by team.

Rippling’s recruiter call lasts up to 30 minutes, and, if you’ve gotten referred in, it isn’t an assessment. The recruiter will introduce you to the company and walk you through the interview process. Without a referral, you may get some light behavioral questions.

Rippling’s technical phone screen lasts about an hour and is conducted in CodePair. It will feature LeetCode-style questions. We will cover what we know of their question style in the section called [“Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Rippling” below](https://interviewing.io/rippling-interview-questions#question-types).

This round can vary depending on team and location. Some hiring managers will use this round to discuss team fit, your background, and the scale and scope of projects you’ve worked on in a general sense.

We’ve heard that other hiring managers will ask you to present a project you’ve worked on and answer questions about it. You will know in advance. If you have to present a project, it’s wise to create slides. You will be asked about workflows and processes, what you were responsible for, what you learned, and what you might do differently. Either way, you will have time to ask questions, so come prepared.

- **Coding** (90 mins). This interview will be conducted in either your own IDE with screen-share or in CodePair. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/rippling-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **System design** (1 hour). Different teams at Rippling use different tooling here. We’ve even heard of one team asking for sketches to be done on paper! For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/rippling-interview-questions#question-design).
- **Coding** (1 hour). This round will be in CodePair. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/rippling-interview-questions#question-coding).

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Rippling

Rippling does ask LeetCode-style questions. Most will be LeetCode medium-level, but we have heard of some harder questions being asked.

There are two coding interviews during the onsite.

**The 90-minute coding interview** will have two parts. In the first one, you will be asked to build something. In the second, you will discuss what you built, what you could have done differently, how you would scale it, etc. This interview will be fairly practical. You might be asked to prepare a simple HTTP server and then write some simple REST APIs.

**The 1-hour coding interview** will be LeetCode-style, but the questions will build on each other. You might be asked to design a data structure where you can get objects, insert objects, and get the average of all the objects in the data structure in a given time.

From one of our users:

> *“You’ll need to get comfortable with LeetCode medium and hard questions – you won’t have time to figure it out on the day. You need to work at a Meta-like pace.”*

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Rippling interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Rippling engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

You shouldn’t encounter anything too unusual here. You might be asked to design a news recommendation engine, a shopping recommendation engine, or a file-sharing system. The key here is to recognize the tradeoffs between approaches early and articulate them. Do move fast though, as they’ll ask a lot of questions about scaling. They are looking for breadth and depth of system design experience here, and this interview is often used for leveling.

# [Robinhood’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/robinhood-interview-questions)

## Robinhood's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 5 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Robinhood can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen (1 hour)
- Recruiter prep call (30 minutes)
- Onsite (5 hours)
- Team matching

![Robinhood’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Additional recruiter call, Onsite, Team matching](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Robinhood_s_Company_Process_61bcb29aaf.png)

Robinhood’s process is centralized, meaning that everyone follows the same standardized process and team matching happens at the end. Moreover, the people interviewing you won’t necessarily be from your future team (and likely won’t be).

This step doesn’t happen 100% of the time. It depends on whether Robinhood recruiters reached out to you or whether you applied. If you applied, you do the recruiter call, and it’s standard stuff. They’ll discuss the role, expectations, your previous work history and Robinhood itself.

It’s really important at this stage not to reveal your salary expectations, salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A).

Robinhood's technical phone screen combines algorithms/data structures and system design, conducted through Karat. If you haven’t interviewed at a company that uses Karat before, it’s basically interviewer-as-a-service – companies pay them to conduct interviews on their behalf. This means that the person you’ll be talking to isn’t a Robinhood employee and won’t be able to answer questions about the team, roadmap, projects, etc. Their only objective is to screen you.

There are 30 minutes for each section, the coding portion will often feature one or two medium difficulty questions, whereas the system design will focus on general knowledge in a trivia-like format.

The second recruiter call is meant primarily to prep you for the onsite, especially if you didn’t do the first call.

The onsite at Robinhood consists of 5 interview rounds with the following steps:

- Coding (1 hour)
- System design (2 hour)
- Past project review (1 hour)
- Hiring manager call (1 hour)

This is an algorithms and data structures interview. Robinhood places an emphasis on correctness over scalability. These interviews typically happen in CoderPad.

Typically, the onsite interviews include two [system design interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) rounds, each covering different aspects. One interview assesses your familiarity with a wide range of system design concepts, emphasizing high-level and well-rounded solutions. The other interview will delve into a specific facet of system design, challenging you to problem-solve in a more targeted area (e.g. front-end system design).

#### Past Project Review

The past project round will evaluate your ability to communicate about technical topics. You’ll be asked to prepare something ahead of time based on a prompt. Be ready to discuss what you bring in depth. An example prompt is: Prepare a system diagram of a previous project.

#### Hiring Manager Call

Robinhood’s hiring manager call is a standard assessment of behavioral and cultural fit. The discussions are centered around role-related scenarios, with the aim of gauging problem solving and communication abilities.

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Robinhood

Robinhood has a question bank with company-specific versions of common questions, but it’s not mandatory for interviewers to use, so there will often be a mix of those and other standard medium difficulty coding problems.

To figure out what specific types of questions to expect in Robinhood interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Robinhood interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you’re likely to encounter:

These questions will usually revolve around Robinhood’s own product, or adjacent/related products.

Common [system design](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) questions at Robinhood include:

- Build Twitter
- Design stock exchange
- Design a new feature for Robinhood
- Build Google Docs

## How Robinhood Makes Hiring Decisions

Robinhood uses a hiring committee to make decisions, except in cases where there is a low volume of candidates for a role. In the event there is a hiring committee, those who participated in the interview directly will come together to discuss and review performance, before coming to an agreement on hire or no hire.

# [Roblox’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/roblox-interview-questions)

Published: June 24, 2024

## Roblox's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Roblox can expect the following hiring process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen (60-90 mins)
- Onsite (4-7 hours)
- Bar raiser interview (1 hour)

At Roblox, the process is decentralized, with a lot of variation in interview steps depending on the role and seniority you are interviewing for. You interview for one specific role, and most of your interviewers, with one exception, will come from the same team.

The stages in the process vary depending on the seniority and role you are interviewing for, with managers having a lot of scope to customize the process for their open roles.

- Referrals will help you get a recruiter call.
- They look for a good match between a candidate’s skills and the role, so make sure your resume matches the job description you apply to.

The entire process takes about 6-8 weeks. By default, they tend to schedule interviews quite far apart compared to other companies, but if you push you can sometimes move things along.

If you get a recruiter call, it’s a great sign that they are genuinely interested. Recruiters will often send resumes to hiring managers before they even take a call so you’ve done well to get this far already. The recruiter call itself lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Roblox, and what you’re looking for moving forward.

There is some variation in the type of screen you might get here, with more senior roles sometimes getting a system design interview. Most mid to senior-level backend and full stack engineers will get a coding round. It will be conducted in CodeSignal. We will cover the types of questions you can get here in the [Coding section](https://interviewing.io/roblox-interview-questions#question-coding) below.

Sometimes you’ll get a recruiter prep call before the onsite. You can split the onsite interviews and complete them over a week or two. The mix of interviews can vary by team, and the more senior you are, the more rounds you can get, but this is what most candidates can expect.

- **2 x Coding** (1 hour). These interviews will be conducted in CodeSignal. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section](https://interviewing.io/roblox-interview-questions#question-coding) below.
- **1-2 x System design** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section](https://interviewing.io/roblox-interview-questions#question-design) below.
- **1-3 Behavioral** (1 hour). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section](https://interviewing.io/roblox-interview-questions#question-behavior) below.

### Step 4: Bar Raiser Interview

If you pass the onsite, the final round will be a bar raiser interview. The style of this interview is unique to Roblox. They will give you a technical problem, likely one they have faced at Roblox in the past, but it will be designed to take you out of your comfort zone. It’s not a coding exercise but more a test of your creativity, intelligence, values and ability to navigate tricky situations.

An example of the type of technical problem might be that people are finding ways to bypass the Roblox moderation system and post inappropriate content.

The problem [in the Bar Raiser interview] will be something uncomfortable for you - something you can’t assign normal CS best practices to. It’ll be a weird situation.

> *The problem [in the Bar Raiser interview] will be something uncomfortable for you - something you can’t assign normal CS best practices to. It’ll be a weird situation.*

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Roblox

Roblox’s coding questions will be LeetCode medium in terms of difficulty but won’t necessarily be LeetCode-style. They will try to place problems in a situational context that is relevant to the type of work you will do there, although you will use algorithms and data structures in your solutions. They aren’t trying to trick you with anything too difficult, but they do want to see clean code. For Roblox, it’s not just about solving the problem, you have to write clean code, run test cases, compile the code etc.

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Roblox interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Roblox engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

Roblox’s system design rounds come in two different styles. One is a standard system design round, and the other is a deep dive into a system you have previously designed or been involved in. If you only get one round during the onsite, it will likely be the former.

For the standard interview, you might be asked to build something like Minesweeper. For the project deep dive, you will be asked to explain how you built something and what the tradeoffs were.

You might have as many as 3 behavioral rounds at Roblox. They can be with the engineering manager, director of engineering and/or VP of engineering overseeing the role you are interviewing for. The interview with the engineering manager and director are standard behavioral interviews, where you will be posed situational questions, and can use something like the STAR method to answer them.

The VP interview is different. It can seem more casual in terms of their tone, but it’s a really critical interview. If you get one of these interviews it’s a good sign that other rounds have gone well, but it is also a round many fail due to treating it casually. They will likely start by going through your resume but will find something to drill down into. They want to hire engineers they can be proud of, so if you have something on your resume, be prepared to justify why it is there and why it makes you a good hire. You might get asked about the project you’re most proud of. Don’t just give them a project that had a successful outcome; show them something that makes you stand out.

> *Don’t be just a nice guy, be impressive, think about your resume and your stories.*

# [Salesforce’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/salesforce-interview-questions)

Published: June 25, 2023

## Salesforce’s Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Salesforce can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen (1 hour)
- Onsite (usually 4 hours but might be more depending on the team)

![Salesforce’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Salesforce_s_Company_Process_60d4a716a8.png)

Salesforce’s process is decentralized, which means that you’re applying to either a specific team or, sometimes, a specific org. Each of their orgs is called [*Something* Cloud](https://rainmakercloud.com/blog/2022/01/18/the-15-types-of-clouds-in-salesforce-and-their-features), so if you’re interviewing at the org level, it might be for, say, Marketing Cloud or IoT Cloud, and which team you end up on will be determined after you interview. That said, how each team or org runs their own process is up to them.

If you end up applying to an org rather than a specific team, you'll do team matching within the org *before* you get your offer numbers.

Finally, our sources tell us that while Salesforce is pretty quick to move for a company of their size once you actually start interviewing. The time from the first interview to offer can take as little as 3 weeks, but they may take a while to get that first interview scheduled.

This is a typical recruiter call, where they’ll ask about previous experience, relevant projects, and why you’re interested in Salesforce and the specific team/org you’re targeting. They’ll also elaborate on the role and confirm that your experience and expectations are a good match.

One important thing – if you’re primarily a back-end engineer, let your recruiter know as soon as possible so they route you accordingly. If you don’t, and you end up saying you’re full-stack when you’re really not (or when you haven’t touched front-end work in a long time), you might be in for a rude awakening in your coding rounds when you have to traverse the DOM or build progress bars in JavaScript. Even though “full-stack” can mean any number of different things depending on the company, at Salesforce, they really mean it!

Finally, it’s really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687335664411636&usg=AOvVaw2y437xxXrTm2-9NHDgDz1y). Just don’t do it – when you give out information this early in the process, you’re painting future you into a corner.

The structure and content of the technical phone screen at Salesforce is team-dependent, as is tooling. One tool you’re likely to see, though, is [Quip](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://quip.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687335664412626&usg=AOvVaw2T-Hsd2TxcJCXmUQdS56j8) (their answer to Google docs).

Salesforce’s onsite lasts roughly 4 hours and consists of the following steps:

- Coding (2 hours)
- System design (1 hour)
- Behavioral (1 hour)

Salesforce’s onsite usually has 2 coding interviews. As with the technical phone screen, tooling varies, but you might have to use Quip (their answer to Google docs).

These are the most important parts of the onsite – both the system design and the behavioral rounds don’t carry as much weight.

This round lasts 1 hour and may also happen in Quip.

The behavioral round is probably the least important out of all the onsite rounds. You’ll get the usual questions about past projects, your contributions, strengths and weaknesses, and so on.

That said, Salesforce really values [the concept of Ohana (family)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.salesforceben.com/what-is-the-salesforce-ohana/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687335664414005&usg=AOvVaw07sLrrAY1tLtQnQilgsbZ6), and you may get questions about the importance of community, supporting your team, the importance of customer relationships, and so on.

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Salesforce

One unique aspect of this round is more of an emphasis on specific programming language skills (rather than the type of language-agnostic interview you might see at FAANGs and many FAANG-adjacent companies).

Moreover, if you’re applying for a full-stack role, you may get front-end or back-end questions, and which you get is up to your interviewer. One typical question is, “Build a progress bar in JavaScript”. If you’re primarily a back-end engineer who’s done some front-end work in the distant past, questions like this may be really jarring..

It’s less likely than at other companies that you’ll get LeetCode-style questions, but you might (again, what you get is team-dependent). However, if you do get them, they’re going to be easy to medium (rather than medium to hard, as you might see with other companies we’ve written about), and our sources tell us that if you practice the top 10 medium-difficulty questions on LeetCode, you’ll be in good shape.

Between the above and cross-referencing it with our own data-set of mock interviews, if you do get back-end, algorithmic questions in your coding interviews, these are the types of questions you’re likely to encounter:

The kinds of questions you’ll get here vary a lot from team to team and may be anything from database-related questions (including writing SQL) to design questions about CRMs (not surprising, given that Salesforce is a CRM company).

You should also study up on the internal tooling the org/team you’re interviewing for uses, as you are likely to get questions about that (e.g., [technologies they’ve acquired somewhat recently](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.salesforceben.com/the-10-biggest-salesforce-acquisitions/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687335664415978&usg=AOvVaw2o8Gsi-xA72ccuDkWEvMRj) like Slack, Quip, Tableau, etc.).

# [Shopify’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/shopify-interview-questions)

## Shopify's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps

For a mid to senior-level software engineer, Shopify’s process (usually) looks like this:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen (40 minutes)
- "Life Story" interview (1 hour)
- Onsite (3-4 hours)

![Shopify’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Life Story interview, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Shopify_s_Company_Process_2d50eabf8f.png)

Shopify’s process is decentralized, which means that you interview for a specific team out of the gate.

The first recruiter call lasts 30 minutes. Its purpose is to check qualifications, hear about past projects, and find out what you’re looking for from Shopify and in general. It also acts as a culture fit check, so they’ll want to see how your communication and personality align with their values. Make sure you’re up to date on Shopify features, blog posts and news. Finally, your recruiter will make sure you understand the role you’re applying for and clarify next steps in the process.

This is a typical recruiter call, but shorter. It’s primarily meant to gauge your interest in Shopify and lay out the rest of the process. There will be a more detailed recruiter call, called the “Life Story” interview, later on.

That said, it’s still really important not to reveal your salary expectations or your salary history. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A). Just don’t do it – when you give out information this early in the process, you’re painting future you into a corner.

Normally, we’d also advise you not to reveal where you are in process with other companies, but we’ve heard from our sources that Shopify is very good at moving quickly if you’re getting close to offer stage with other companies, so if you need them to move, make sure to mention that in this call (you don’t have to go into detail about which companies you’re talking to, just that you’re getting close to offers or have some already).

The technical phone screen at Shopify is a data structures/algorithms interview conducted via CoderPad. There will likely be 2 interviewers conducting this round.

### Step 3: "Life Story" interview

This interview is conducted by a recruiter, who will be asking you questions about your past to see what motivates and drives you: is there some common thread that’s been a theme or shown up in multiple places in your story and your career to date? Their goal is to suss out whether you’re a “3D person” who can communicate effectively with others, instead of just someone who’s technically gifted. Because Shopify is fully remote, they place extra importance on having employees who are personable and able to have a chat.

You may also be asked to sign [Shopify’s code of conduct](https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_downloads/Governance%20document/2019/Code-of-Conduct-as-amended-May-29-2019.pdf) (we were able to find this copy from 2019; please email us to let us know if it’s no longer valid).

Shopify’s onsite lasts roughly 4 hours and includes the following steps:

- Pair programming (2 hours)
- Technical deep dive (1 hour)
- Possibly system design (1 hour; usually just for senior/staff-level engineers)

#### Pair Programming/Coding

You’ll have two separate pair programming sessions as part of your onsite.

In these interviews, you’ll be using your IDE of choice and sharing your screen.

When you practice for this interview, get in the habit of talking out loud about what may work even if it's not ideal, and explain to the interviewer what you would do differently, or how you would improve it if you had more time. The goal isn’t just to solve the problem, but to show that you know what you’re doing and are able to consider the long-term effects of your design decisions.

#### Technical Deep Dive

In this interview, you’ll be doing a deep dive on a project you worked on, why it mattered, your contributions, how you overcame challenges, and so on. Be prepared to discuss technical details in depth.

You may not get a separate system design interview in your loop – those are reserved for senior (and sometimes staff-level candidates). There will be a system design component in your pair programming sessions, however.

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Shopify

### Coding/Pair Programming

You’re more likely to get LeetCode-style questions in the technical phone screen, rather than the onsite.

To figure out what types of questions to expect in your Shopify interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Shopify interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you’re likely to encounter:

During the onsite, you will not get LeetCode-style questions. Rather, you will iteratively build something with your interviewer. You’ll start with the simplest possible implementation and then add features to it, testing as you go. Depending on how the interview is going, your interviewer will likely add on up to three additional layers of complexity, and what started as a simple problem will end up with a system design component as well.

Example questions include:

- Design and implement an LRU cache
- Given a list of products with a price and popularity rating, order them based on price and use popularity as a tiebreaker
- Implement a discounting feature for retail

If you do get a [system design round](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview), be prepared for high-level system design questions that will likely expect a tie into a feature/design relevant to Shopify’s product.

## Common Shopify Interview Questions

# [Snap’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/snap-interview-questions)

## Snap's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Snap can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (1 hour)
- Technical phone screen (1 hour)
- Onsite (6 hours)

![Snap’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Snap_s_Company_Process_f5523e80b8.png)

Snap’s interview process is fully centralized, which means that everyone enters the same standardized process, and team matching happens at the end.

Like [Amazon](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon), Snap has interviewers who are trained up to be Bar Raisers, except that they’re called Deciders. Instead of Leadership Principles, they evaluate candidates on their adherence to Snap’s values: “We are Kind, “We are Smart”, and “We are Creative”. Note that Snap’s behavioral evaluations are spread across all of your interviews, so, unlike most companies, there isn’t a dedicated behavioral interview. Make sure to keep the Snap values in mind during your rounds. They’re also looking for product knowledge and passion for Snap in every interview, so make sure you’re familiar with the app and ready to talk about it. Review their values and specifically their engineering values before heading into your interviews!

Finally, Snap has a bar that’s been described to us as “unexpectedly high”, and exactly how high can vary from team to team.

Snap’s recruiter call is pretty typical, but in addition to the standard recruiter questions, they may ask you product questions or want to hear about your usage of the app and its features. Be sure to spend some time playing around with their product before going in.

It’s really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A).

The technical phone screen at Snap is a data structures/algorithms interview via HackerRank (their interview tool, not the async assessment tool). Depending on the interviewer, there may also be some light behavioral questions in this round (as we mentioned earlier, behavioral questions will be sprinkled throughout the process).

The onsite at Snap consists of 6 interview rounds with the following steps:

- Coding (4 hours)
- System design (1 hour)
- Q&A (30 minutes to 1 hour)

There are generally four interviews focused on algorithms and data structures. The main thing they’re looking for besides a working solution that actually runs is speed.

The [system design interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) at Snap will focus on high-level system design questions and will likely expect a tie into a feature/design relevant to their product.

#### Q&A

Once you’ve wrapped up your technical interviews, you’ll get the chance to chat with a hiring manager and ask any burning questions you may have about Snap. This round isn’t meant to be an evaluation and does not factor into whether you get an offer.

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Snap

Snap's coding questions come from a company-wide question bank and are usually LeetCode-style questions ranging from medium to hard difficulty.

To figure out what types of questions to expect in your Snap interviews, we did 2 things. First, we spoke to some current and former Snap interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you’re likely to encounter:

Typical questions include:

- Design a chat app
- Design an ad server
- Design a photo sharing app
- Design a document management system

## Common Snap Interview Questions

Below are common questions that interviewers from Snap ask on our platform. Since our data comes from mock interviews, questions may not be exactly the same as what you'd see in real interviews.

### [Reverse a Linked List](https://interviewing.io/questions/reverse-linked-list)

[Given a linked list with nodes that have an additional pointer referring to another node in the list, return a deep copy of the list.](https://interviewing.io/questions/copy-list-with-random-pointers)

## How Snap Makes Hiring Decisions

Once you’ve wrapped up your onsite, you’ll be given an offer based on the performance in the technical interviews, decided by your interviewers. Once you receive and accept your offer, you’ll begin the team matching process (given that team matching comes after an offer in their process, we didn’t officially include it as part of the interview).

This process can take several weeks (or longer in some cases), and consists of multiple calls with different interested hiring managers from across Snap.

# [Snowflake’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/snowflake-interview-questions)

Published: June 28, 2023

## Snowflake’s Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Snowflake can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- (Possible) Hiring manager screen (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen (2 hours)
- Onsite (4 hours)

![Snowflake’s interview process: Recruiter call, possibly a hiring manager screen, technical phone screen, onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Snowflake_s_Company_Process_4813d73a40.png)

Snowflake’s process isn’t centralized, so there can be differences from team to team in terms of exactly how many interviews are required, what type, and what order they’re scheduled in. You’ll also generally be interviewing with members of the team you’ve applied to.

Snowflake’s recruiter call is pretty typical. They’ll ask about your background and interests, and how they relate to the role you’re interviewing for. In some cases this call will also replace the hiring manager call, depending on if the recruiter is aware of exactly what the hiring manager of the specific team is looking for.

Whether you talk to a hiring manager or not depends on which team you’re applying for and the relationship that the hiring manager and the recruiter have – if the hiring manager feels that the recruiter is well-calibrated, they may opt to skip this step.

In the event that you do speak with a hiring manager, they’ll talk to you about your background and see how well it fits with the role and their specific team. They’re looking to see how well your passions, interests, and previous experience ties into the Snowflake values as well, and how it will translate into your role. Ideally, they’d like to see some overlap in your hobbies and the things you’ll be doing at work.

The hiring managers at Snowflake are encouraged to share all good candidates with other teams, so even if you’re not a good fit for their exact team, they may help you find something else.

The technical phone screen at Snowflake consists of BOTH a data structures/algorithms interview AND A system design interview. That’s why it takes 2 hours. These are conducted via CoderPad and Zoom.

In addition to having a strong back-end focus, Snowflake’s interviews test your ability to perform within a specific team. It’s also important to note that since Snowflake is a database company, a lot of the interview questions will involve having some more database expertise and knowledge than your average company.

Snowflake’s onsite is usually virtual and takes place over Zoom using CoderPad. While the type/amount of rounds may vary from team to team, generally you can expect to see the following depending on your level:

##### **Mid-to-senior (IC3 and 4):**

- **Presentation (30 minutes)**: This interview is usually with multiple engineers from the team you’re applying for and is an opportunity to showcase a past project in a way that highlights your technical ability and foundational knowledge.
- **Coding (1 hour)**
- **Expertise (1 hour)**: This is a technical interview that will touch on skills relevant for the specific team you’re interviewing for. It may be coding, system design, or both. Or it could be a deep dive into a specific language or framework (again depending on the team).
- **Behavioral (1 hour)**: This interview is usually with a project manager but sometimes a hiring manager will do it, depending on your team.
- **Close (1 hour)**: This is a final call, with a recruiter or a senior leader (depending on the team), to answer any last questions about the role and team, and to potentially wrap up any loose ends from previous rounds.

##### **Principal (IC5 and above):**

- **Presentation (30 minutes)**: Same as mid-level above.
- **Coding (1 hour)**
- **Expertise (1 hour)**: Same as mid-level above.
- **Behavioral (1 hour)**: Same as mid-level above.
- **Cross-functional (1 hour)**: This will be an interview with members from multiple teams across Snowflake who will come prepared with their own questions as it pertains to their department and your potential team.
- **Close (1 hour)**: Same as mid-level above.

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Snowflake

For coding interviews, you can expect algorithmic questions that are around a LeetCode medium, but with a Snowflake-specific twist and a focus on database internals. An example question is: Get a log file, aggregate the logs, and do it in a way that won’t take too long.

Even if the questions aren’t pure LeetCode, they will touch on a variety of technical topics. As such, to figure out what technical topics to expect in your Snowflake interviews, we did 2 things. First, we spoke to some current and former Snowflake interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes with our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you’re likely to encounter:

This interview will focus more on data systems and database design, and the generic “Design Instagram” types of questions are much less common.

An example question could be: Take in events that happened at a certain time, keep track of and organize them so that you can retrieve them quickly, and insert new events quickly while keeping track of the tradeoffs.

## Common Snowflake Interview Questions

Below are common questions that interviewers from Snowflake ask on our platform. Since our data comes from mock interviews, questions may not be exactly the same as what you'd see in real interviews.

### [Decode String](https://interviewing.io/questions/decode-string)

[Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.](https://interviewing.io/questions/decode-string)

### How Snowflake Makes Hiring Decisions

Once you’ve finished your onsite, the team you’re interviewing with at Snowflake will meet and discuss your performance, review the interviews and make a decision. This usually takes a few days, after which you’ll receive feedback for each round and find out whether or not there’s an offer.

# [SpaceX’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/spacex-interview-questions)

Published: December 3, 2023

## SpaceX's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at SpaceX can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (15 minutes)
- Hiring manager call (1 hour)
- Asynchronous coding assessment (3 hours of work, 2 weeks to complete)
- Onsite (5 hours)

![SpaceX’s interview process: Recruiter call, Hiring manager call, Asynchronous coding assessment, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Space_X_Company_Process_7639e7f4fb.png)

SpaceX has a hybrid hiring process. You apply to a general job posting, and the recruiting team will decide if they want to have a call. After you speak with them, they will shortlist your profile and show it to different hiring managers. If a hiring manager thinks there is a good fit, you’ll move forward to speak with them. If you make it through that call and an offline coding assessment, you’ll head to the onsite phase where you’ll be interviewed by engineers from the hiring manager’s team.

To work at SpaceX you need to be a permanent resident and/or citizen of the United States.

From what we’ve been told, the entire process can take about four weeks.

- Go onsite in person. They put a lot of stock in personal relationships, and visiting the site is worth it!
- They don’t need you to get to full solutions, focus on asking the right questions and showing them how you think about the problems.
- LeetCode is helpful for practice, but they are really looking for your ability to solve real-world challenges and pull from your experience.
- Invest a lot of time in the presentation
- Know [Elon Musk's 5-step Design Process](https://modelthinkers.com/mental-model/musks-5-step-design-process).

SpaceX’s recruiter call lasts 15 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, and why you’re interested in SpaceX

This is usually a hybrid call, with some questions about your experience and some technical questions. As the hiring manager has picked your profile from a shortlist, they will have seen something in your background that they want to delve into. After that, you might get a system design question that relates to your previous work or the team you are interviewing with.

### Step 3: Asynchronous Coding Assessment

This assessment should take you 3 hours, but you have 2 weeks to complete it. It takes place on Codility. Expect medium-level LeetCode questions that you can find online but with slightly different descriptions.

The onsite can be virtual or on-location. As above, try to actually go onsite if possible. Seeing the rockets alone is worth it but, they also like to meet people in person. You’ll get an additional 45 mins to have lunch with the recruiter. This is a great time to ask good questions and build rapport.

- **Facility tour** (if in person, 25 mins) The recruiter will walk you around the site.
- **Prepared project/source code presentation** (1 hour). You’ll be asked to suggest five ideas ahead of time, and they’ll pick the one they’d like you to present in person. The presentation will be in front of the entire team. This is a really important step in the process. You’ll be asked to present your project and some of the source code (if possible), and they will ask lots of questions throughout your presentation. Keep Elon Musk’s 5-step Design Process in mind here. They look for simplicity in your approach.
- **Coding** (1 hour). This will likely be in CodeSignal. There might be some design elements here in addition to coding, and it will usually relate to SpaceX. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/spacex-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **Lunch** (if onsite, 45 mins) This will be with the recruiter and is a great time for you to ask good questions.
- **Second Coding** (1 hour). This will likely be in CodeSignal and is usually conducted by two interviewers. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/spacex-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **System design** (1 hour) For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/spacex-interview-questions#question-design).
- **Behavioral** (1 hour) This interview is with the hiring manager. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/spacex-interview-questions#question-behavioral).

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at SpaceX

Don’t expect LeetCode-style questions at the onsite stage. Instead, you’ll see hybrid questions that have an algorithmic component, a coding component, and a design component. SpaceX likes to ask questions that make you think and draw on previous experience. A lot of their coding questions will bear some relation to real-world SpaceX problems. Talk through your approach, as it’s more important to show how you think than to reach a full solution.

From one of our users who recently went through SpaceX interviews:

> *The coding portion was more about normal logic and problem-solving design questions which did not require deep algorithmic knowledge: more about understanding the problem, asking the right questions, and providing SIMPLE and scalable design.*

A sample question might focus on spare parts for rockets and how to keep track of them as they move in and out of refrigeration. You may have to write code that tracks and logs the time each spare part is out, for instance.

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in SpaceX interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former SpaceX engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

Outside of the topics above, you may see questions about data hazards, memory management, and generally questions that get at your understanding of how programming works under the hood (e.g., compilers).

Here you will likely be presented with a relatively straightforward design task but not given many details. For instance, you might be asked to design an inventory management system that
involves multiple locations and items, similar to the example in the coding section above, except that in this interview, you’ll be focusing more on the design and less on the coding parts. In the inventory management system question, you’ll have to:

- Design database tables for managing spare part inventory
- Think about how to handle movement and transfers of items
- Discuss how you would do this at scale.

Note that these questions will intentionally sound simple, and your interviewer will not provide a lot of details – they’re looking to see how you deal with ambiguity and how you ask questions to fill in the blanks.

The behavioral interview is another critical step in the process. It’s possible that you perform well in this interview but poorly in one or more coding sessions yet remain in the process. If that happens’ you’ll likely be asked to do another coding interview.

Expect to encounter similar questions to the [Amazon Leadership Principles](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles) type of interview during this round.

One engineer we spoke to also said they were asked how they felt about working with Product Managers. They told SpaceX it wasn’t always necessary to work with one and the interviewer seemed happy. It’s possible they do not have PMs.

### How SpaceX Makes Hiring Decisions

Decisions are at the hiring manager's discretion but they look for consensus. If you fail a round you might be asked to complete an additional interview. For example, if you fail one of the coding rounds, you might get another to complete.

# [Spotify’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/spotify-interview-questions)

## Spotify's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps

For a mid to senior-level software engineer, Spotify’s process (usually) looks like this:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen (75 minutes)
- Onsite (4 hours)

![Spotify’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Spotify_s_Company_Process_3347d11538.png)

Spotify is notorious for moving slowly, so don’t be surprised if there are a couple of weeks of lull in between each of these steps.

Spotify’s interview process is a hybrid, which means that while you interview for a specific team at the outset, your interviewers won’t all be from that team. Usually, you will meet the hiring manager and one other engineer on the team. The rest of your interviewers will be from other teams. One exception to this rule is high-profile teams, in which case you may meet with 2 different engineers from that team.

Because you’re interviewing with a specific team from the outset, there is no additional matching round. However, for open-ended roles or in cases where you did well in your interviews, but the original team wasn’t a fit for whatever reason, they’ll pass you to a call with hiring managers where they sell you on joining their teams instead.

This is a typical recruiter call, where they’ll ask about previous experience, relevant projects, and why you’re interested in Spotify. They’ll also elaborate on the role and confirm that your experience and expectations are a good match.

The exact process can vary from team to team. Generally, you’re asked technical trivia questions and some values-based questions, followed by coding.

How interviews are conducted also varies. The most frequently used tools are Coderpad, HackerRank, and in some cases, you’ll be asked to share your screen and use your IDE while you work through the problems you’re given.

Finally, you may be asked to describe a past relevant project you’ve worked on. Make sure you’re prepared to demo and/or go into detail.

Spotify’s onsite usually lasts 4 hours and consists of the following steps:

- Case Study (1 hour)
- Coding (1 hour)
- System design (1 hour)
- Behavioral/Values (1 hour)

The order of these rounds can vary, as well as the number of coding interviews required. Depending on your score for various portions of the onsite, you may be required to complete an extra system design, object oriented design, or algorithms interview. There may be extra rounds for certain teams and roles as well. Given that Spotify’s interview process is centralized, you generally won’t be interviewing with engineers or managers from the team you’ll end up on.

The technical interview will consist of domain-specific questions, values-based questions, and a few medium to hard difficulty LeetCode-style questions.

As with the technical phone screen, tooling is team-dependent.

For the system design interview, Spotify wants to see a broad and general understanding of the system design process, they'll also mix in domain specific questions. Generally the questions will follow the format of "Design a system that does (x)" with an opportunity for follow-up questions on scalability.

Spotify uses [Mural](https://mural.co) for system design interviews.

The most important round in Spotify’s onsite is the case study interview. In this interview, you’ll be presented with a very open-ended real-world problem that may require debugging a system to figure out what’s wrong with it or to figure out why some process has stalled.

Some system design diagrams may be shared with you, along with fake terminals, code snippets, and so on.

This interview requires lots of dialogue and critical thinking, and the expectation is that you’ll ask your interviewer a bunch of questions. Successful candidates will have a broad understanding of the software engineering process itself, as well as a broad understanding of the system design process.

#### Values/Behavioral

Spotify places great importance on their values and on candidates being good culture fits. Their values are as follows:

- Innovative
- Collaborative
- Passionate
- Playful
- Sincere

In this interview, you’ll get a series of behavioral questions that try to get at the following (taken verbatim from their careers site):

- Do your values align with our values?
- Do you take ownership of your work and take pride in what you deliver?
- Are you adaptable?
- Are you collaborative?
- Are you driven?

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Spotify

This interview usually has a few medium to hard difficulty LeetCode-style questions.

To figure out what types of questions to expect in your Spotify interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Spotify interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you’re likely to encounter.

From what we’ve heard, Spotify’s [system design interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) follows the format of “Design a system (or feature) that does X” followed by a discussion about scalability, concurrency, and/or load balancing.

## Common Spotify Interview Questions

Below are common questions that interviewers from Spotify ask on our platform. Since our data comes from mock interviews, questions may not be exactly the same as what you'd see in real interviews.

## How Spotify Makes Hiring Decisions

At Spotify, the hiring manager has final say over who gets hired. They do have a rubric, but there is no specific score or bar that guarantees an offer, and the hiring manager has space to hire someone for potential or because they were impressed with the candidate’s communication style, even if their technical skills were borderline.

# [Stripe’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/stripe-interview-questions)

Published: September 24, 2023

## Stripe's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Stripe can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen with any engineer at the company (1 hour)
- Second recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Onsite (5 hours)

Staff-level and above engineers interviewing at Stripe will follow the same basic 3 steps but with some variation at the Onsite stage. We’ll get to that later.

![Stripe's interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Recruiter Call, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Stripe_s_Company_Process_938ad18527.png)

Stripe has a hybrid process. Their eng team is divided into two orgs: Product and Infrastructure. You interview for a specific org, but your interview loop will have engineers involved from across the company, as well as a hiring manager from the specific org you are interviewing for. There is likely some flexibility in terms of which team in that org you end up on. That discussion usually happens post-onsite. You will have the opportunity to discuss team placement during the onsite interview with the hiring manager.

The entire process takes about 6 weeks but can be completed in as little as 2 weeks, particularly if you are a referral, according to our sources.

Stripe’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Stripe, your understanding of Stripe’s value proposition, and what you’re looking for moving forward. They’ll also review the specific role you’re applying for to make sure you understand the expectations and requirements and go over the hiring process.

It’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. [We’ve written a detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter).

Stripe’s technical phone screen lasts about an hour. You can use either your own IDE and share your screen or you can just use CoderPad. They leave it up to you; whatever you’re most comfortable with.

Expect the unexpected here i.e., they won’t ask standard LeetCode-style questions. We will cover what we know of their question style in the section called "[Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Stripe](https://interviewing.io/stripe-interview-questions#question-types)" below.

The hiring managers at Stripe are encouraged to share all good candidates with other teams, so even if you’re not a good fit for their exact team, they may help you find something else.

This is an informational call to help prepare you for the onsite.

- **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in either your own IDE with screen-share or in CoderPad. Your choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/stripe-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in either your own drawing tool with screen-share or in Whimsical. Your choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/stripe-interview-questions#question-design).
- **Bug bash** (1 hour). You’ll be given a piece of code and will have to find the bug(s). They usually pick something that they’ve actually seen before, so it will be a generic version of a real Stripe bug. In this round, they’re looking for you to approach the problem thoughtfully and test different approaches, rather than just barreling into something and hitting a wall
- **[For roles below Staff] Integrations** (1 hour). You’ll be asked to use the Stripe API here, and it will be based on real-world integrations they've seen their merchant customers create. If you interview in the Integrations org, you will not get this round.
- **[For Staff roles and above] Presentation** (1 hour). You’ll have to write a one pager about a past project and present this to a staff-level engineer, and one other, more junior engineer who will take notes. You’ll be asked to explain it, and the panel will assess your ability to communicate both via written word and to a live technical audience. They want to test your ability to give business context or rationale for what you did, and your ability to justify technical decisions. They may also ask you what you’d do in situations where constraints changed on the fly. They will assess the scope of the project and probe for your use of soft power to get the project done. This interview is particularly important for leveling – if candidates can’t effectively communicate the business impact of their work, for instance, they may be down-leveled.
- **Behavioral** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted by a hiring manager or a “Leveler” – someone who interviews across a lot of levels and tries to maintain a consistent bar, similar to a Bar Raiser at [Amazon](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/stripe-interview-questions#question-behavioral).

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Stripe

All of Stripe’s interview questions are created in-house. They run questions through tests internally via mock interviews. They are tested for fairness and fun-ness. Don’t expect industry standard questions here. Be prepared to encounter something unusual but hopefully interesting! Stripe really values proactivity and independent thinking so their questions are aimed at testing you for those skill sets.

Stripe’s questions are language-agnostic but might change a little bit depending on the language used. They playtest the questions internally to figure out if they are easier or more difficult in certain languages, and the interviewer will adjust as needed during your interview.

“Stripe is not for everyone” is something we heard often while writing this piece. You get a lot of freedom to do things you think are important, but that comes with the responsibility to deliver. If you thrive in that kind of culture you’ll do well, but if you like to operate in a more rigid structure with very clear instructions and deliverables, you might not enjoy it there.

Stripe does not ask LeetCode questions, and grinding on LeetCode may end up being counterproductive. Instead, they tend to be practical questions that originate with the work that Stripe engineers do every day. This means that while computer science fundamentals matter, questions designed to get at them will not be formulated the same way as LeetCode problems.

This interview will be less algorithms and data structures heavy than the LeetCode-style of interview you’re probably used to. Expect questions like:

- How would you build a simple version of Identity Access Management?
- How would you blur credit card numbers from logs?
- Design a rate limiter in any programming language

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Stripe interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Stripe engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

This round focuses mostly on large systems and will involve designing an entire service with scalability, reliability, and usability concerns in mind. What technologies would you use and why? What are you optimizing for? Would you use a relational or non-relational database? How would caching work? And so on.

This varies by role. For IC roles you’ll be asked about your own experiences. For management roles, you will be asked about how you would handle certain scenarios (e.g., underperforming direct reports, conflict in your org, etc.).

Like Amazon, Stripe has some principles they harken back to when evaluating your responses. They’re called [Operating Principles](https://stripe.com/jobs/culture) (the analog to [Amazon’s Leadership Principles](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles)). Unlike Amazon, however, you won’t be asked behavioral questions in other rounds, just like this one.

### How Stripe Makes Hiring Decisions

The entire onsite panel submits written feedback after the interviews are completed and then meets to discuss. Most of the time, decisions are reached by consensus (everyone agrees to hire or no-hire), but in cases where consensus isn’t possible, the hiring manager has final say.

# [TikTok’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/tiktok-interview-questions)

Published: October 19, 2023

## TikTok's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 5 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at TikTok can expect the following process, although there are variations from team to team:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Moral equivalent of an onsite (even though each interview is separate, and you have to pass one to get to the next) consists of:
  - Technical phone screen (30 minutes)
  - Second technical phone screen (1 hour)
  - System design (1 hour)
  - Behavioral (1 hour)

![TikTok’s interview process: Recruiter call, Multi-step “virtual onsite” (where you have to pass each round to get to the next)](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Tik_Tok_s_Company_Process_a844d35564.png)

At TikTok, the process is decentralized, and you can usually interview for more than one team at a time. We have heard that certain teams do not allow this, but for the most part, it’s safe to apply to multiple positions. As each team manages its own headcount and process it is unlikely that you will be able to skip any steps for one team that you’ve already completed for another, i.e., you’ll still have to complete the full process each time. Your interviewers will all come from the team you are interviewing for.

As a lot of TikTok’s engineers are based in China, particularly their senior managers, you can expect to have interviews that overlap with Chinese business hours (e.g., Sunday evenings, other evenings).

Unlike other companies where your virtual onsite will have all of your interviews scheduled on the same day, at TikTok you are likely to do one interview at a time, having to pass each one to get to the next.

The entire process takes about 5 weeks, although it can move much faster, especially if you let them know that you need to have your interviews complete by a certain date, e.g., if you have competing offers. TikTok is very amenable to moving quickly if they think there’s a chance they’ll lose out, but you’ll have to actively and repeatedly remind your recruiter to move faster.

General tips for interviewing with TikTok:

- Be prepared to interview during Chinese business hours and even to be asked questions in Mandarin if you’ve added it to your resume.
- Be prepared for huge variations in the process between teams. TikTok is hiring like crazy, and they don’t have an official process.
- Practice LeetCode-style questions! They rely heavily on these questions in your first few technical rounds.
- If you need them to move quickly, they can, but you have to really push and keep pushing. That goes for scheduling, and it goes for getting an offer in a timely fashion as well. If you keep bringing up that you have another offer, they’ll move.

TikTok’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s more informational than anything else. You’ll be briefed on the process and prepared for the first interview. You may also be asked some questions about the company and your background.

If you have offer deadlines coming up and need TikTok to move faster, mention that on this call, and keep reminding your recruiter of it. We’d advise not going into details about where you’re interviewing til you’re ready to start negotiating (read more how to manage your negotiations at the start of your job search), but we do advise hammering home the point that you’re in a rush (if you are).

TikTok’s first technical phone screen is relatively straightforward and should only take about 30 minutes. It’s usually done in HackerRank. If you brush up on LeetCode questions, you should do fine here.

At TikTok, there isn’t a discrete onsite portion of the hiring process. Instead, you will do each interview one by one and have to pass them one at a time to move forward. That said, once you get past the first technical screen, the order will look similar to other company’s onsite interviews. Onsite interview loops also vary depending on the role and seniority, but the below is generally what you’ll get:

- **Coding** (1 hour). This is much more challenging than the technical phone screen and should last about an hour. The interview is usually conducted by someone on the team you are interviewing for and will use HackerRank. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/tiktok-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be in HackerRank and will be conducted by a hiring manager on the team. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/tiktok-interview-questions#question-design).
- **Behavioral** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted by a skip-level manager. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/tiktok-interview-questions#question-behavioral).

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at TikTok

The types of questions asked at TikTok vary by team, but you can expect a lot of industry-standard LeetCode-style questions.

Expect LeetCode-style questions here. Most teams are language agnostic. The first interview will be fairly simple, based on feedback we’ve gotten. The second one is a lot harder. A few of the engineers we spoke to recommended brushing up on synchronized read/write locks for the second interview, in particular.

Outside of concurrency and threading, below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in TikTok interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former TikTok engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

This round focuses mostly on large systems and will likely involve designing an entire service with scalability, reliability, and usability concerns in mind. Some example questions:

- [Design LeetCode](https://interviewing.io/questions/design-leetcode). What technologies would you use and why? What are you optimizing for? How would logging work for every single user action on such a large scale? And so on.
- Design a system that can handle logging on a large scale for every single user action. Imagine 100k users are coming in and there are 5 different services. Each service has to do its own logging and send it to one final database. How would you do this?

This varies by role, but be prepared to discuss your background, impactful projects you’ve worked on, and times you’ve shown initiative.

Culture fit seems to be very important to TikTok, even as they are growing so fast. Their teams are based mainly in China so that brings its own unique flavor, and you should be prepared for it.

### How TikTok Makes Hiring Decisions

This varies from team to team, but it’s likely at the discretion of the hiring manager, with input from other team members.

# [Uber’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/uber-interview-questions)

Published: July 28, 2024

## Uber's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Uber can expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Technical Phone Screen (1 hour)
- Onsite (4-5.5 hours)

![Uber’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical Phone Screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Uber_s_company_process_337ca52852.png)

Uber’s interview process was centralized in the past but is in the process of becoming decentralized because they tend to only hire for specific roles in the current market. Right now, it looks to be a hybrid, and practically speaking, that means if you were to apply today, you might be matched with a specific team at the outset or you might do team matching at the end. We’ve seen both, and it appears to be a function of how niche your skills are (e.g., if you’re an ML engineer, you’ll likely be matched with a specific team at the outset).

That said, your interviewing panel will likely all be from the same org and use a company-wide, internal question bank. Candidates tend to interview for only one role, and though the process is somewhat standardized, the hiring manager will have a say in what the process will look like as well, so expect a little bit of variance.

- LeetCode practice will help a lot with the coding portion. The system design interviews are pretty standard as well.
- They want you to write code that runs during coding rounds.
- Referrals will help; you may even be able to skip the technical phone screen with one.
- Be prepared to be grilled on your past experience and projects, particularly during the Collaboration and Leadership and Bar Raiser rounds.
- If you go through team matching, it may take a while (weeks to months).

The entire process takes about 4-6 weeks but possibly longer if you end up having to do team matching.

Uber’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll speak about the role and team you are interviewing for, discuss salary, location, and level expectations, and ask about your interest in Uber.

Although we heard from one engineer that they were able to skip this stage with a referral, most senior engineers will get a pretty standard technical screen here. It will be conducted in CodeSignal, and there may be one or two questions. The questions themselves will be algorithmic. They have an internal bank of questions that most interviewers use, some of which are versions of real problems that Uber has had to solve in the past, and some of which are standard algorithmic questions with some Uber-isms papered over the top, but there does seem to be some variance. Either way, expect LeetCode medium in terms of difficulty.

It’s important to write fully compilable code here, i.e., code that runs. You should also run test cases.

One engineer, familiar with the process told us:

> *You might get slightly harder questions first, and it’s OK to ask for help. If you do solve it without help, it’s a definite pass, but you can still pass with help assuming your communication skills etc. are good.*

This will vary slightly by role but most engineers can expect something like this:

- **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CodeSignal. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/uber-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **Second coding (depth in specialization)** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CodeSignal. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/uber-interview-questions#question-coding).
- **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CodeSignal. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/uber-interview-questions#question-design).
- **Collaboration and Leadership** (75 mins). This is with the hiring manager for the role. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Collaboration and Leadership section below](https://interviewing.io/uber-interview-questions#question-collaboration).
- **Bar raiser** (1 hour) This is with a special bar raiser interviewer. For more infor about what questions to expect, the [Bar Raiser section below](https://interviewing.io/uber-interview-questions#question-bar-raiser).

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Uber

This round will be just like the technical phone screen – they have an internal bank of questions that most interviewers use, some of which are versions of real problems that Uber has had to solve in the past, and some of which are standard algorithmic questions with some Uber-isms papered over the top. If you get LeetCode-style questions, they’ll be of medium difficulty or slightly harder. Note that you may get two questions, but if you do, they’ll likely be mediums.

You should get in the habit of running test cases, if it’s not something you do by default already..

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Uber interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Uber engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:

### Second Coding (Depth of Specialization)

We’ve heard from multiple engineers that this round is sometimes just another LeetCode-style coding round but sometimes it’s not an algorithmic question at all. This round is meant to be more reflective of the role you are interviewing for and may include some design aspects.

One engineer we spoke with said:

> *This round is supposed to be more focused on [a mix of code and] designing… where you might have to build a mobile game like Snake, but in reality it’s very similar to the first coding round, and interviewers often use something from the internal question bank.*

Note that your recruiter may not be prepared to set expectations for this round, as there seems to be a lot of variability in how it’s run, possibly at the request of the hiring manager. Ask as much as you can about the round beforehand, but be prepared for a possible curveball.

Most of the people we interviewed told us to expect a very standard system design round, so you shouldn’t expect many surprises here. That said, they have an internal bank of questions that are based on old problems they had to solve at Uber so you might be asked to solve one of those. You might be asked to design a map that shows every Uber driver in the world. It won’t be a typical distributed systems question (like design a chat app), and you will need to focus on scale. Think about Uber in the early days and the problems they had to solve.

You’ll see other, more standard, questions such as:

- Design Dropbox
- Design Facebook Messenger
- Design a ride-sharing app (surprise!)
- Design a card game
- Design an industrial system

### Collaboration and Leadership

This interview will be conducted by the hiring manager for the role you are interviewing for, or in some cases, a hiring manager from the same org.

There seem to be two distinct styles used:

- You will be asked to go through past projects and how they were delivered
- You will be asked how you *would* deliver potential projects

The hiring manager can take this in any direction they see fit,but they are looking to test your ability to work on a team, your ability to deal with failures, and your leadership skills. Have your past projects ready to discuss in detail, they might drill down into one specific project if it seems interesting. Be able to quantify both your impact and the impact of the project.

If the role is a speciality role, they might ask you questions that are relevant to it, e.g., if the role includes some frontend aspects, be prepared for some frontend questions.

### Bar Raiser

Ok, this is where things get serious. If you’ve made it this far, it’s a good sign. We only spoke to one Uber engineer who did not get a bar raiser round and got hired. Everyone else told us that you need to pass one to get hired and that they sometimes won’t schedule it if the rest of your onsite hasn’t gone well.

Similar to [Amazon](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon#amazon), which is known for this type of interview, the bar raiser interviewer will be a specialty interviewer from across the company. They won’t be part of the team you are interviewing for. They will choose the focus on the interview. We’ve heard it’s usually a reverse system design / project introspection style of interview, but if you weren’t strong in one of the other onsite rounds, it might be a repeat of that.

If it is a reverse system design / project introspection interview, they will likely ask you to discuss one past project in deep detail. They will ask questions around:

- The technical complexity of the project
- The project’s impact
- The high level architecture decisions and the pros and cons associated
- The time it took to complete the project and/or reach each milestone
- Any failures

Be prepared to quantify the project’s impact where possible. The project discussed should match the level of seniority you are interviewing for in terms of scale and scope. A staff engineer will need to talk about a project that spans at least 2 or 3 quarters of work for example, but a senior engineer can use something a little less complex. They are looking for your depth of knowledge here and this round is used for leveling. It’s probably the most important round you will have.

### How Uber Makes Hiring Decisions

The entire interview panel meets, and the decision should be unanimous. If there is a mixed signal, people on the panel can try to convince others until they achieve consensus. Typically, one soft no-hire can be turned around, but one strong no-hire will be enough to reject you. In rare cases, the Bar Raiser interviewer can also overturn a hire decision.

# [VMware’s Interview Process & Questions](https://interviewing.io/vmware-interview-questions)

## VMware's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at VMware can (usually) expect the following process:

- Recruiter call (30 minutes)
- Technical phone screen (1 hour)
- Onsite (5-6 hours)

![VMware's interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/VM_Ware_s_Company_Process_d97f92854f.png)

That said, VMware’s interview process is very decentralized. You interview for a specific team from the get-go, and not only the content of the interviews, but the types of interviews themselves, vary significantly from team to team, so take the list above with a grain of salt.

One other somewhat unique aspect of VMware’s process is their commitment to the Rooney Rule, i.e., [committing to interviewing at least one woman and one minority candidate for every open position](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/19/no-job-hire-made-unless-minority-candidate-interviewed-vmware-ceo.html). In practice, sometimes the entire process for a role will get stalled until recruiting can find those candidates, and all candidates who are not from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds may end up in an indefinite holding pattern.

Finally, a word about VMware’s eng culture. VMware wants to find very technical people who are interested in solving hard problems but also want to go home at the end of the day. VMware’s sales cycles are slow – there’s just one big release every year, so they don't need to find people who are willing to work really long hours or people whose job is to make sure that the build tool chain is on the cutting edge (and in fact, most of their customers, who tend to be huge enterprise organizations, don't want cutting edge).

This is a typical recruiter call, where they’ll ask about previous experience, relevant projects, and why you’re interested in VMware. They’ll also elaborate on the role and confirm that your experience and expectations are a good match.

This is a 1-hour long algorithmic interview. You will likely be using [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io) in your technical phone screen, but tools vary from team to team.

Depending on the role, you may have a virtual onsite or an in-person onsite. In either event they follow similar formats. The exact composition will vary not only with the team but with your seniority – if you’re a mid-level engineer they will be more focused on coding. If you’re very senior, your interview will be much more about what you’ve done in the past — your work history, your work style, technical decisions you’ve made and so on. At the highest levels, the interview will feel more like an exchange of stories rather than vetting for a specific skill.

Some of your questions will invariably involve VMware-specific products and knowledge, so make sure you do some background research before heading in.‘

That said, VMware’s onsite lasts between 5 and 6 hours and consists of the following rounds:

The order of these rounds can vary, as well as the number of coding interviews required. Depending on your score for various portions of the onsite, you may be required to complete an extra system design, object oriented design, or algorithms interview. There may be extra rounds for certain teams and roles as well. Given that VMware’s interview process is centralized, you generally won’t be interviewing with engineers or managers from the team you’ll end up on.

At minimum there will be two algorithms and data structures interviews in your onsite loop. Your interview will happen in CoderPad if it’s remote, but if it’s in person, it’ll be on a physical whiteboard.

There will be one or two design rounds depending on your specific role and focus.

#### (Potential) Hiring manage round

The main purpose of this round is to chat about your past projects and work experience, and they’re very focused on your ability to communicate technical details clearly and concisely. Try to come prepared to talk about projects that are relevant to VMware and its values.

This call’s aim is to assess your fit for VMware and will focus heavily on the company’s values and mission.

## Types of Interview Questions to Expect at VMware

Coding questions will focus on algorithms and data structures, and while the questions asked can vary depending on the role, you’ll likely see medium to hard-difficulty LeetCode style problems.

To figure out what types of questions to expect in your VMWare interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former VMWare interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you’re likely to encounter:

These rounds tend to ask you to build or design something team-specific, and they’re really looking at your ability to clearly explain your approach and choices.

## Common VMware Interview Questions

Below are common questions that interviewers from VMware ask on our platform. Since our data comes from mock interviews, questions may not be exactly the same as what you'd see in real interviews.
